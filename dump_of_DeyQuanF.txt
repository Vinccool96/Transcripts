Let me tell you about necromancy, /tg/. I played a necromancer once, in what I thought was a solo game over IRC.

&nbsp;

I went around to places where the economy was horrible, the rulers were tyrants, and the people were downtrodden.

&nbsp;

There, hidden in cairns and crypts, I taught. I taught the people how to use the dead in their defense--and when defense was not needed, in their fields. I taught spellcraft and surgery. I taught them to think for themselves.

&nbsp;

I overthrew tyrants, I saved civilizations. I left in my wake prosperous, well-fed democracies, populated by the living and the working dead.

&nbsp;

Eventually, I became old. Tired. I knew that lichdom was not for me--benefits aside, I was ready to move on. I had mastered this side of death--yet there was so much more to learn, that required intimate knowledge of the other side.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/20/11, 00:48

As I prepared my final resting place, with a missive spell to go out to all my proteges, I used a simple scrying spell to view the places I had visited, once more.

&nbsp;

What I saw surprised and disgusted me. The living once again worked the fields, instead of the schools and libraries. So-called 'good kings' once more had tyranny over the people. Ignorance and fear ruled these lands again. And bodies were cremated, even the bones, and scattered so that no necromancer could use them, for good or for ill.

&nbsp;

I traced back the lines of fate to find what had caused such disasters, what had destroyed the lands which I had saved.

&nbsp;

Adventurers, So-called saviors, hunting down the most powerful necromancer in the world. The Arch-Lich, they called me. I wasn't even dead! The stories they circulated claimed I had lived a thousand-thousand years, spreading misery and the walking dead in my wake. Misery, most certainly not, and I was scarcely sixty years old, though my mentor had certainly lived a long time, and his mentor before him. I was not even a lich!

Not long after I discovered this, my body failing, one organ at the time, this group of adventurers found me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/20/11, 00:49

I lay on my deathbed. They were expecting a fight, some cackling, evil mastermind to kill so that they could have been called heroes. They did not expect an old, bitter man who had seen his life's work destroyed because of paranoia and bigotry.

&nbsp;

I told them what I had done, and why I had done it. I told them of my hopes and dreams, for a world where no living man would have to work, where all could spend time doing what they truely desired--study, advancement, even the simple pleasures of a small farm and family, if they so wished. A world free of petty tyrants, where each man could vote for the ruler of their town or their nation.
In the end, I cried. For my proteges, good men dead at the hands of these heroes. For my plans, dashed against the rocks of hatred. For myself, an old, broken dying man with a wasted life.

&nbsp;

As it turns out, my DM was using me as the BBEG for another campaign he was running... and according to him, I succeeded beautifully.

My DM and group decided to stat an evil campaign, something I didnt really want to take pat in and in hindsight should have not joined at all.

&nbsp;

My character was in a group that contained a barbarian cannibal, a witch that poisoned wells on whims, and a wizard that wanted to take over the world. I was playing a rogue.

&nbsp;

In our partys downtime, which was spent in a city the wizard wanted to take over, we each did our own thing- The barbarian stated an underground arena where he ate the losers, the witch and wizard experimented on slaves, and my character stalked a young girl.

&nbsp;

That's it Just making hide checks and watching a young girl from a distance. Whatever my intents were, I didnt reveal them, and this made everyone feel what I consider unreasonably uncomfoftable.

&nbsp;

The barbarian, who enjoyed describing the different pats of the humans he ate as supple or juicy, was the first to tell me out of character that I was fucked up.

&nbsp;

The rest of the group chimed in, but when I reminded them that no one said anything when the witch injected demon blood into a pregnant slave's belly in an attempt to aftificially create a half-demon (and ended up just poisoning both the mother and the fetus), they grudgingly kept quiet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:01

The DM, as if to try and dissuade me from my chosen course, had the young girl's life be remarkably uneventful. She woke up, had breakfast, and went to the academy where she studied. After classes, she went home, had dinner, studied some more, and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

After six months of in-game time, the barbarian had a small group of cannibalistic gladiators as his underlings, the witch had successfully stated a pan-demon breading project, and the wizard had infiltrated the High Council of the city and had stated secretly administering a highly addictive drug. My character had learned the young girl's name, knew her favorite foods, saw which students she got along with, and even had a pretty good idea of which boys fancied her.

&nbsp;

At first, I had thought that the rest of the group was uncomfoftable with me stalking the young girl because they thought my character was doing it for sexual purposes. Slowly, I realized it was because over the course of the game sessions, they had all stated to care, in their own small ways, about this studious little girl Though their characters did horrible, unspeakable things to people, those people were all nameless strangers that none of them saw as humans. My character, however, was getting to know his intended victim, carefully and diligently, with the rest of the group slowly getting to know her as well.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:02
 
By the time the wizard had full control of the city, his player knew that the little girl wanted to study exotic plants, especially flowers. The academy that he know had complete control over was her favorite place in the world, and her worst fear was if something aver happened to it.

&nbsp;

The witch had minor demons raping slaves in secret chambers within the sewers, with many of their foul progeny spilling out into the streets above. A few of these chambers were dangerously close to the roads the young girl took to get to school, though thankfully for her the monsters only came out during the night.

&nbsp;

The barbarian had been tracked down by a trio of bastards he had spawned many years ago, each of them seeking to kill the father who had abandoned them- After the barbarian had killed and devoured them, in the end the player knew less about his characters own children than he did about the stranger that the partys rogue had decided to stalk.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:02

By then, everyone had stated to suspect that I had no ill-intent towards the girl I had done nothing to interact with the girl, nothing even remotely involved with her, besides being a stone's throw away from her as much as possible. The barbarian proposed a theory, in that my character's only intent was to hone his stealth skill during his free time and that l, being unwilling to actually commit to being evil, had chosen a "mildly evil-themed" approach. I didnt refute this theory.

&nbsp;

After that moment, the group seemed to actually take an interest in the young girl From a callous perspective, they were just using her to provide their characters with someone they could be good towards just to create a greater sense of depravity in the evil they committed. From a kinder perspective, the players were good people at heat and just couldn't be evil to the young girl3
The Academy was provided with extra funding, and a set of green houses were built for the excluswe use of the students. The demon blood experiments were now under close supeMsion, with nightly patrols to 
help eradicate the escaped specimens. The barbarian, straightfomard as ever, simply approached the girl, gave her a rare potted plant, and told her that if she ever wanted anything, she could ask him for it 

**!/jexuKnPKY**, 05/28/2012, 19:03

In the following months, she became a soft of mascot for the group. Though all of their methods were evil, they now justified their actions by saying they were for the benefit of this young girl, who they secretly (and not so secretly) doted upom At first, only the barbarian was on speaking terms with the girl, but after the wizard took an official position as a governor of the school and the witch soon followed after him, they all came to know the girl, more than they had Simply through my characters observations.

&nbsp;

Our campaign was slowly, ever so slowly, shifting in alignment as the players began to question their characters methods. As they grew closer to the young girl, it became harder and harder to conceal their experiments and activities. At first, they only stopped the most Ob/lOUS ones, but eventually the die-hard evil group had shifted to a rather neutral, if not patially good, party.

&nbsp;

Our DM, who loved character arcs and unlikely story progression, praised my character for introducing an element into the story that allowed a group of evil people to redeem themselves. As he described the young girl walking home from the greenhouses, the DM took a moment to also say that he suspected that I had always planned to eventually turn the evil campaign into an ordinary one.

&nbsp;

Laughing, I told him I had never had such an intent, and then I told him how my character silently emerged from the shadows, stalked towards the girl, and stabbed her in the neck.

**Unknown author**, unknown time

A statue made out of pure sodium. The group's techpriest went full overthinking mode, thinking (rightly) that there was a trap, and (wrongly) checked the entire room except for the statue itself.

The group's archmillitant then took the statue, and dragged it into the underwater passage that was the only way out of the room - it was glorious.

[Drawing of Death, a skeleton in a black cloak holding a scythe, pointing at the viewer with a menacing expression on his face.]

I posted this late last night, but I'm posting it again for all you morningfags.

&nbsp;

(Story starts below)

&nbsp;

So in my DnD 3.5 game, death is a living entity, right? I gave him divine rank 0 for shits and giggles in case the players ever felt like slaying death and starting on their way to godhood.

&nbsp;

Anyway, as per every Death ever, my death let's people challenge him to a game of their choosing. If they win, they can come back to life with no level loss or anything. Of course, death rarely loses. Not only this, but he can choose to not allow a particular challenge. He often only does this in cases of “lol lets play I win you lose”

&nbsp;

The party consists of a fighter, cleric, binder, and wizard. In an almost total party wipe, everyone but the binder died. Damn nasty frost worm nest that was…I’ve never seen so many 20s.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/23/2009, 15:18

All three naturally challenge Death to a game. The fighter, thinking he’s clever with his Greater Cleave and such, challenges Death to a goblin slaying contest. First one to kill the most 1st level warrior goblins, out of an infinate number, in one minute (ten rounds) wins. Death pumped out a bunch of AOE spells, making good use of quickened spell, and won.

&nbsp;

The cleric challenges Death to a game of pleasing the cleric’s god; Pelor. Whomever performs the most acts appeasing Pelor in 24 hours wins, Pelor himself deciding. The cleric enters into a meditation and communicates with his deity that he only entered this pact to have things done in his favor, therefor anything Death ends up doing should be counted for him as well. He then performs a ritualistic dance to one up this number so it wouldn’t be a tie. Death then goes to slay a bunch of Pelor followers and Pelor is so pissed that, even though the cleric won and was revived, Pelor smites him back into dust. Death laughed and asked if he’d like another game, but the Cleric just said no.

&nbsp;

Finally, the wizard challenges Death to a game of wits. Wow wizard, way to be original. He proposes that they ask each other riddles until someone gets three wrong. Death just made up shitty riddles with no real way to answer them unless you were really lucky or on his same though process and won.

&nbsp;

So I’m laughing my ass off right about now. Suddenly the binder says he wants to challenge death to a game for his companion’s souls. If the binder wins, they are all revived. He loses, death can take him too. Death says sure. So the binder challenges death to a game of planar hide and seek, with death as the hider and the binder as the seeker. Death wins if the binder can’t find him in two weeks. No invisibility/scrying/disguises/etc allowed. The Binder spends the time fighting the frost worms who so violently defeated his allies. Naturally he loses and Death pops up to take him to the afterlife. The binder just smiles and says “Found you.” Death giggled so hard he decided to revive the Binder along with his buddies.

My players complain about the campaign having too much mindless killing when it's only that way because they force it that way.

They want a mystery game. I give them a mystery game. They do the bare minimum amount of searching and just turn to murder the second they think they solved it. Their definition of "solved it" is different than the sort you'd find in any dictionary.

&nbsp;

Posted this before, but...

&nbsp;

>Players want a mystery game

>Run a Clue-style murder mystery, tell everyone to make PCs as such

>One guy is a big beefy bouncer type. He's big, beats people to death with a literal club, and is incapable of doing anything else of note.

>Two roll up a pair of bank robbers. They shoot first, shoot second,and keep shooting until there's no one left to ask questions to.

>Fourth rolls up a private investigator, if only because someone had to have investigation skills. Even then he spent most of his points split between martial arts and shooting people.

&nbsp;

>They get invited to the isolated manor for on reason or another and either drive up or take a cab.

>They get greeted by a butler, who has a blonde maid(remember this part) take them upstairs to see the master of the house.

>Partway outside the door, they hear a yell and a gunshot.

>Them and the maid rush into the room to find the master dead, and someone jumping out the window. They're gone by the time they run over to look outside.

>The police are called and no one is allowed to leave.

>No footprints or any sign of someone leaving are found, so the culprit MUST still be on the premises.

>The PCs go up to look. And by the I mean the private eye does while everyone else flips over tables and shoves paintings and bookcases aside looking for stuff to loot

>No attempt to keep the crime scene as is or not tamper with evidence

>Private eye does his thing

>Gripped in the man's hand is a few strands of blonde hair, you check the gu-

>OF COURSE, the group declares, the killer had blonde hair!

>The decide this is enough to lock down the killer's identity and leave the room.

>They make no further attempt to check the body or find more evidence. Even the guys who loot the place don't find it odd there was no sign of a struggle, or that none of the loot was touched, or that there was no sign of forced entry or anything.

>They quickly make a list of everyone they know who has blonde hair. Considering they've only spoken to two people so far, this is a very short list.

>Wait, the maid had blonde hair. Of course, SHE must be the killer. You know, the one who was with us when we saw the man killed, and is the only person that can't be the killer.

>Nope, she has blonde hair, the killer has blonde hair, case closed.

>Instead of going to the police, they take matters into their own brain damaged hands.

>They find the maid on the second floor, grieving.

>I hope they try to interrogate her or make some attempt to find the truth. Even have her alibi "I was with you when he died you dipshits" all prepared.

Embellished slightly to make it seem more dramatic/silly I'll admit.

&nbsp;

Everything in the story did actually happen though. That was probably the most drastic example I've had happen still.

&nbsp;

Every mystery game ends something like they though.

>Party has mystery because they want to have a less murder-frenzy game

>They do the bare minimum investigating to find a single clue

>They decide that single clue is the entire lynchpin of their investigation, jump to the first conclusion they come to based on that one clue.

>They run with that one conclusion and just start murdering everything involved.

>Get angry when they start fighting back, blame me for turning it into a murder frenzy game.

&nbsp;

I just run murder frenzy games for them. They still whine, but they're all fine just getting railroaded from one murderfest to the next. One of them decided to run their own game once because he wanted to show me "How you run a mystery right."

&nbsp;

It was the sort of baby's first theft mystery you'd find in an Encyclopedia Brown book, and we "solved" it in about 10 minutes

I've played a campaign where we got to the final battle, and the primary villain destroyed the Fighter's magic sword. The Fighter went:

&nbsp;

> "Well, I guess I can't do anything to hurt him now. I kill myself."

&nbsp;

Then the Rogue went "Shit, then I kill myself too, since we can't win the fight." The Wizard said "Half of the party is dead, I guess I kill myself." That left me, the Cleric. Deciding to show solidarity, I said "I'm the only guy left? I kill myself." 

&nbsp;

I like to think that after this spontaneous outbreak of suicide, the villain just sat in a bar and wondered what the fuck this was all about.

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:36

I have a couple of stories floating around /tg/ at this point, most about D&D with my amazing DM, but what people don't know about him is just how dark he can get.

&nbsp;

Take our Call of Cthulhu campaign.

&nbsp;

See, we got a little bit uppity and may have over stepped our bounds, which put the DM, or GM in this case, into maximum passive-aggressive mode. In 3 sessions, a group of 4 of players lost no less than two dozen characters. And they went out brutally.

&nbsp;

Some caught fire, some lost their minds and went rambling into the night, and more than a couple shot themselves after taking out an ally or semi-important NPC. Needless to say, we had lost a lot of hope for playing a full campaign with a single character.

&nbsp;

And then I created Bonzy, the sad clown.

&nbsp;

Bonzy was my way of trying to apologize to the GM, a way to appease him if you will. After all, what better way to show heartbreak than with a symbol of joy and fun shattered into a broken and unloved shell?

&nbsp;

Bonzy dressed simply. He wore very little makeup, a small red nose, had dark hair, and his clown uniform was covered with an old, worn trench-coat that was not as bad-ass as it implied. He had a slight drinking problem, but managed to maintain sobriety without withdrawal, and never seemed to crack a smile.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:38

He met the other players by chance, having missed his bus and decided to bum it in the town for a few days because hell, it's not like he really had anywhere to be after all. The first character to find me thought I was a traveling clown, and tried to strike up a chat about his chosen career.

&nbsp;

“Hey, Bonzy, know any good jokes?”

“... Why did little Suzy fall of the swings?”

“I don't know, why?”

“Because little Suzy lost her arms to cancer years ago.”

Bonzy sighed, slowly reached up, and honked his nose.

&nbsp;

The table was dead quiet, save for the player I just spoke to. He wore a priceless expression of “sweet god you're serious” and quietly giggled.

&nbsp;

“Do, uh, you know any others?”

“Knock knock.”

“Who's there?”

“Not Suzy.”

Honk

&nbsp;

The game proceeded rather organically from there, with the occasional interjection from Bonzy on why the town was fucked up and we should leave. When they encountered a librarian who just so 'happened' to be the local cult leader, Bonzy was the first to know. After all, who else would know when someone was faking anything?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:39

The trap we set was simple, but if anyone here has played Call of Cthulhu, then you know simple doesn't mean jack. We entered the library, two of us moving to the roof, the third sneaking behind the building. Leading the charge? The only one who didn't care what happened; Bonzy. The sad clown ever so quietly knocked on the door, watching the librarian fish for his keys as rain gently drizzled in the night outside the windows. Bonzy entered, took off his coat, and draped it over his arm with only a few words of greetings.

&nbsp;

As we talked, our third guy suddenly found himself at the business end of a shotgun, and as if he was a machine, pulled out another character sheet and started generating a new character. The other two were just as unlucky, knocked down and grappled by other cultists who were on the stairwell. Everyone was already pulling out sheets, muttering how they made a mistake and were going to do better next time.

&nbsp;

But they forgot Bonzy.

After all, nobody cares about Bonzy.

&nbsp;

The librarian, still unaware of the ruse, pretends to act nice, talking about the books and how he hopes that the fire was going to be enough to dry off. And then, Bonzy hearing the clattering, decides to act. The librarian also decides to ask the obvious question of Bonzy.

&nbsp;

“So, since you're a clown, I'm sure you know plenty of jokes. Got any about books?”

“Sure. What did the one book say to the other?”

“What?”

“I was just checking to see if we were on the same page.”

HONK

BLAM

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:40

Bonzy fired the revolver he was hiding under his coat, spreading the librarians brains over the bookshelves directly behind him. This of course alerted the cultists to the sad clown below, and the one behind the building decided to investigate, leaving the tied up player beaten, but alive.

&nbsp;

The cultist rounds the corner, pulling out his gun and trying to spot something in the library. He never saw Bonzy behind him with the law book.

&nbsp;

Ten hits over the head later, Bonzy wipes the blood off his face and examines his work.

“Guess I threw the book at you.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The other three cultists on the room, send two of their own to investigate, which were promptly disposed of by the sad clown lurking in the shadows with the gun and a collected works of Shakesphere.

“Not to be, I guess.”

HONK

&nbsp;

After freeing his allies and finding a map of the area, Bonzy turned to his group, and stated flatly

“I'll be in the car. Reading in the dark is bad for your eyes.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The campaign continued without much happening for awhile, losing only one member in the span of a month of game time, which we thought spoke highly of our redeemed status, but I wouldn't stop yet. I wanted to ensure our GM wasn't going to kill us in the middle of the night. Bonzy remained just as sad, and it served him well when they met the second group of cultists.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:06

The location was an abandoned funeral home. Apparently, the cult was of an eldritch god who was most powerful with the dead. No big surprise, seeing as everyone up to this point had connections with some dead family member from years ago. We pull the car around the back, two sneak in the vent, and two (Bonzy) sneak in the back door. We knock out two guards and tie them up with a stretchy rubber chicken, then make our way deeper into the building. First room we find with a cult? The morgue.

&nbsp;

The cultist tosses a knife, landing in Bonzy's ally shoulder. Bonzy pulls out a gun and fires off two into the cultists chest, killing him and blowing their cover. Bonzy wastes no times in preparing his next plan. He pulls out the knife and stifles the wound (Having been a performer, he had dealt with knife wounds before), and told him to wait by the door with a gun while Bonzy waddled into the shadows to meet up with the rest of the group. He spotted a cultist in the hall, but managed to hide long enough to sneak behind him as the cultist passed.

&nbsp;

Bonzy raised the knife to his throat, and quietly slit it before he could alert the others.

&nbsp;

“Guess that was a close shave.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The other upstairs cleared the rest out, and helped Bonzy lug the wounded character back to the car, but not before they saw another group of cultists preparing for something nasty in the wings of the funeral home, so Bonzy opts to investigate, with a friend of course. Bonzy was sad, not stupid.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:08

Investigating paid off, and Bonzy and the friend uncover the cultists attempting a ritual to summon their dead god. The character says with a few minutes, he can put a bomb together, but it looks like it'll take more time. So, Bonzy volunteers.

&nbsp;

Imagine the cultists surprise when this rather depressed looking clown waddles out from the shadows, holding a little flower and a deck of cards. It was time for the routine.

&nbsp;

“What did the dead god say to the humorless cultists?”

“...”

“Is it dead in here or what?”

HONK

&nbsp;

“Who are you, clown?”

“Please, call me Bonzy. Clown was my father.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The cultists mutter a hushed debate about how to kill Bonzy, who was taking this time to turn the flower into a napkin, and then pulling it out of his sleeve. One cultist got closer, and Bonzy offered him a hand of cards.

&nbsp;

“Pick a card, any card.”

The cultist reached for a card-

“Not that one.”

The cultist stopped, and reached for another-

“Not that one either!”

Finally, the cultist grabs his card, studies it, and offers it to Bonzy.

“Why are you giving it back?”

“Because you're going to make it disappear.”

“And waste a perfectly good playing card?”

HONK

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:09

The cultists finally run out of humor and pull out knives to sacrifice the sad clown before them to their dead god. Lucky Bonzy, the friend finishes the bomb just in time, which he tosses to Bonzy. The clown lifts it up as the timer counts down. The cultists back up, waiting for a pun from the strange clown.

&nbsp;

“No clever words this time?”

“... Not really.”

“Are you out of jokes?”

“No, I just want to go out with a bang.”

HONK

&nbsp;

After we high tailed it out of there, the group managed to save the player with the knife wound, and Bonzy survived with only minor injuries and a scar on his upper arm from a brazing bullet. Dozens of puns, sad clown routines, and close shaves later, we decoded the last clue from the books, and we had it. The final showdown spot where everything must come to an end. And I think somewhere, we all knew Bonzy was tired of being sad all the time.

&nbsp;

Bonzy was going to finally have his peace.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:38

A graveyard, hundreds of years old, and plenty creepy, was full of cultists that seemed armed to the teeth with daggers and strange magic. We had found a way to hoard the weapons from the police station, and entered the fray like a 4 man army right out of the pulp fiction books. We left nothing in our wake, and cleverly averted disaster after disaster. Bonzy took a couple of hits, but he was already sad, so it wasn't like anyone noticed. When we reached the last, inner circle of the cult, we took a small vote about who would take point, and the most dangerous position, on our last mission. Bonzy doesn't even finish listening, instead waddling out onto the dark grass and honking his nose with the deepest frown on his face.

&nbsp;

The cultists debate killing me, but the leader lets Bonzy draw closer. I think it was out of curiosity rather than an ingenious plan, but whatever drove him allowed Bonzy to draw within punching distance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:39

There were no words, no puns, only the cold stares of two men in the dark, surrouned by ancient chanting and dark magic that warps the very flesh of any who touch it. Then Bonzy pulls out a long balloon (which I mimicked, having practiced this for a week in advance).

&nbsp;

“You know what I hate most about being a clown?” Bonzy asked after inflating the balloon.

“It's the assumption that I'm going to he happy, and smiling, and always ready with a joke. Everyone sees a clown and suddenly, they can't be unhappy. At least, not really unhappy. How can someone with a lifetime of jokes and puns ever be sad? Shouldn't they be smiling and laughing and carrying around rubber chickens all the time?”

&nbsp;

Bonzy shows the balloon to the cultist, revealing a puppy. I offered the real one to my GM.

&nbsp;

“But we can be sad. In fact, I think we HAVE to be sad. People want to be happy so much, they'll ignore everyone around them to keep their illusion of happiness. I accept that. After all, I'm Bonzy. My job is to be unhappy so everyone else can be happy, and smile, and laugh. That's what clowns do, we make people happy.”

&nbsp;

Bonzy reaches into his sleeve, and pulls out the only picture on his persons. A little girl with a young, smiling Bonzy.

&nbsp;

“I wanted Suzy to be happy.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:40

Bonzy reveals a grenade in his other hand, just underneath the balloon animal. As the cultist pulls away, he realizes he's too late to notice the grenade pin attached to the bottom loop on the feet of the balloon puppy. As it clings, the cultist drops the balloon and shouts for everyone to back up. Bonzy smiles as the rest of the team clears out the inner circle, leaving the leader and Bonzy near the center. As he's about to leave, Bonzy grabs the man's wrist and slides on a trick cuff.

&nbsp;

The leader looks down at his wrist, and then back up to Bonzy, who is honest to god smiling as the eldritch monster begins to manifest in the mortal world. Bonzy picks up the animal, holds it up, and grins gently as the eldritch god begins to take form.

&nbsp;

“That's all, folks.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The rest of the group looked for hours through the bloody, mangled mess of the god and cultists for anything of Bonzy, but they found nothing. Were it not for Bonzy blowing up the heart of the monster as it arrived, the undead god would have fully formed and taken the world with plagues of undeath and decay, but now it lay broken and would need to reform over eons in the cold reaches of space.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:41

The party did manage to find something of Bonzy, finding a lone, old photo of a smiling clown and a little girl.

&nbsp;

They took the photo had a few words on the back, and the GM read them in a quiet voice.

&nbsp;

“To Bonzy. Thank you for always making her happy. Suzy thanks you.”

&nbsp;

They left the photo on a small gravemarker in the towns newer graveyard, and they decided to leave town. Before they left, one produced a rubber nose from his pocket and tied it to the grave.

And like that, they left Bonzy, not the sad clown.

The clown that was sad so everyone else could be happy.

**Anonymous**, unknown time

We tried to be 'Good necromancers' and managed to fuck it up so hard that we became the villains. Drow were invading a city, and we were trying to stop them. Using an ancient nexus of necromantic power, we created an army of the dead, two thousands strong, with three large flesh golems.

&nbsp;

Then we exhausted said Nexus and used the power to teleport this army.

&nbsp;

To the wrong city.

&nbsp;

Massive undead army literally pops up out of nowhere during the king's parade, everybody starts screaming, the five guys in necromantic robes at the head of the army start trying to calm people down by screaming at them, which just makes things worse (we completely flunked every diplomacy and intimidate roll because nobody had those skills), they get attacked by guards and defend themselves using nonlethal chain lightning, making the populace even more terrified. A local death cult took this to be a sign from their god and started summoning even more undead while whispering prayers to the five necromancers.

&nbsp;

Before you know it the city is burning, the guard has been decimated, there have been thousands of casualties, and five mages are standing in the centre of the ruins, next to a fountain that has been desecrated, avoiding each other's gaze.

&nbsp;

>"So, uh..."

>"Yeah."

>"That was a thing."

>"It was. What now?"

>"I don't suppose we could just apologise and explain the misunderstanding?"

>All five necromancers look around at the city of death and fire that they inadvertently created

>"I don't think they would buy it."

>"Probably not."

>"Damn."

>"..."

>"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I need a drink."

>"Second."

>"Yep."

>"Can't make things any worse, I guess."

>"I think we destroyed all the taverns, guys."

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:17

Holy shit, this thread's alive?

&nbsp;

Still?

&nbsp;

Well, apparently the people want to hear of Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

The Saga begins where most of my tales of 'what the fuck just happened' did, Dark Heresy.

&nbsp;

Back when I didn't know how the rules worked (actually, I still don't. On purpose. Back then I cared.) I was shown a Random Character Generator for the system.

&nbsp;

What I ended up with was a guy who had only two real talents: Playing his Bass Guitar, and Running.

&nbsp;

He was mostly broke, only owning the cloths on his back, his Bass Guitar, and a Couch that was 'In remarkably good shape'.

&nbsp;

He was a psyker, one of the really weak ones (so weak it was actually impossible to tell IC if he was).

&nbsp;

He had a look that could only be described as 'Business casual, if it was slept in. For about a week.'

&nbsp;

When he was described to the group, one of my friends remarked 'So you're playing some sort of Magical Hobo?'

&nbsp;

That's where his name came from. The original name, that was rolled for, was immediately discarded for the moniker of 'Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo'.

&nbsp;

If you give me a minute, I'll start typing up the shit that happened.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:32

First mission for the Inquisitor, I wasn't in the group yet.

&nbsp;

They landed in the hive where I was living to investigate some sort of disappearance of an associate.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe was trying to remember where he put has bottle of Sacra.

&nbsp;

They met up with some local arbitrators, got some leads, and went hunting.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe played his Bass with a rhythm so perfect it created an impromptu dance party in the lower hive.

&nbsp;

The acolytes got into a heated firefight just outside the pub where Boxcar Joe was trying to drink his lunch in peace.

&nbsp;

He stepped out, and this is where I became aware of my surroundings.

&nbsp;

On my left, A tech-priest, some sort of imperial assassin, two guardsman, and someone who looks like they just stepped out of a pulp PI novel from the 50's. Trench coat, fedora, whole shebang.

&nbsp;

On my right, 50 genestealers. Give Or Take.

&nbsp;

I grabbed my bottle, and chucked it at the xenos.

&nbsp;

I won't lie and pretend I remember all of the numbers, but:

&nbsp;

>The bottle hit a Hive Tyrant that was invisable for some reason.

>Said hive tyrant had its eyes burned by the pure alcohol

>Hive tyrant thrashed into bridge.

>30+tonnes of Concrete and other building materials fall, killing all but two genestealers. One is shot by the detective, the other Joe kicks in the face so hard it gets decapitated.

&nbsp;

I then looked over at the stunned group.

&nbsp;

"Off-worlders, yeah? You have to watch the local cockroach population. bastards get real uppity every couple of years."

&nbsp;

I was then shanghaied into the group.

&nbsp;

I'm not going to tell all the DH related tales, but he lasted pretty much the entire campaign. Whenever he was directly involved in a confrontation, all rolls would go right to either end of the spectrum. Every other roll was a Crit or a Crit-Fail.

&nbsp;

In the end, he got sucked into the warp surfing his couch.

That isn't the end of his story.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:45

About a month later, I was running a Shadowrun game (4th if it matters).

&nbsp;

They were all rolling up characters, and there was one new guy who wasn't there for the DH game.

&nbsp;

He opted for a random creation thing.

&nbsp;

Ended up with a technical pacifist Hobo street shaman who lived on a couch in a downtown alleyway.

&nbsp;

He owned a Bass Guitar, Aviator shades that looked slightly too big for him, and his couch was even described as 'in remarkibly good shape'.

&nbsp;

We all joked that two different computers with two different random generators had created Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

After explaining why it was so fucked up to the new guy, he laughed and named his character Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

The game went along normally for a while, and then the first combat happened.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe grabbed a can of tomato soup, spent a point of edge, grabbed six dice, and let fly at one of the guys trying to mug him.

&nbsp;We have 

a rule when it comes to exploding dice: every other time a die 'explodes' the intended effect gets bigger.

&nbsp;

27 hits later, all seven thugs (one of whom was hiding around the corner) were dead from the side effects of that thrown can. One gun also discharged into a passing truck, instantly killing the driver with a head-shot and bringing the delivery van to a crashing halt into the entrance of the alley.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe starts freaking out, because stopping the thugs cost him his dinner.

&nbsp;

Before anyone in the group could console him, the back door of the delivery van popped open revealing the randomly rolled for cargo: Assorted food-stuffs.

&nbsp;

The game lasted about six months, and in the second to the last session Boxcar Joe lost control of a spell and got thrown into a magic portal out of reality.

&nbsp;

After that game, a couple of our players went their separate ways. We played some games with some new guys, and then I ran into one of the dudes who left.

&nbsp;

He had a story to tell about Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:59

Turns out that she played in a Delta Green game, and one of the guys in the group, using some form of random generator, ended up creating Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

When she met him for the first time in the game, she started laughing about the character, saying he sounded like someone from an earlier game: Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

At this point, according to her telling, the group fell silent. They showed her the sheet.

&nbsp;

Name: Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

They then informed her that it was a running joke for a couple of local groups, where a musically inclined 'Magic Hobo' with a couch 'in surprisingly good shape' had turned up in more than a few random character generators.

&nbsp;

Part of the running joke was that Boxcar Joe played merry-hell with the dice-gods and the laws of probability.

&nbsp;

So then I asked her to find out when these games happened in relation to ours.

&nbsp;

After doing some math (and a little bit of guesswork) I made an interesting discovery: Firstly, due to a combination of game schedules and campaign lengths, it seems as though Boxcar Joe was not in any two games at once. In parallel running games yes, but if one game was on a Tuesday and so was another, something would happen that would amount to Boxcar Joe going away for that one session (like the guy being sick).

&nbsp;

Secondly: Every time Boxcar Joe has left a game, he hasn't died. At least not in a way that the body was ever found.

&nbsp;

Sucked into a portal, thrown off a cliff, Gellar Field failure, etc. Almost certain deaths in every-case, but no body ever found.

&nbsp;

Sometimes the game ends and Boxcar Joe just hitches a ride out of town or something, never to be seen again.

&nbsp;

As a result, I have a sneaking suspicion that every appearance of the character 'Boxcar Joe' is in fact the same person.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 02:07

As far as my personal theory goes I have two pieces of evidence in my favor: Every instance of his apperance that I can find involved both a random character generator, and the laws of probability going right out the window.

&nbsp;

The implications of this same person appearing in (no particular order) Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Shadowrun, Exalted, Old AND New Worlds of Darkness, Deadlands, Call of Cthulhu, Delta Green, DRYH, Star Wars, MAID, six different GURPS games, D&D (Faerun, Ebberon, Dark Sun, Spell Jammer, and at least two homebrew settings), Fantasy Craft, Spy Craft, and about six different homebrew games?

&nbsp;

Fucked if I know.

&nbsp;

Not sure I want to.

&nbsp;

A friend of mine once pointed out that if we swapped the couch out for a phone-booth, he would bare an uncanny resemblance to The Doctor.

&nbsp;

I'd rather not think on that possibility too hard.

>Look, I'm not saying there are secret meetings where priests and paladins plan the destruction of undead, but the recent influx of humans adventurers into our catacombs is no coincidence, and past dwarf immigration into our outer dungeons hugely problematic. If we don't close our borders and force these lesser creatures away, we'll be facing the downfall of underworld society as we know it.

My friend and I are really unoriginal, when we make PCs. We'll usually base them off of already established fictional characters. In Shadowrun, we played as a hitman duo (me being a cyborg, him being a mage) called the Krane aros_ Essentially, they were Frasier and Niles Crane from Frasier. When our characters were introduced, the party's stealth expert was eavesdropping on our latest hit- a client's embezzling coworker shot between the eyes in the middle of dinner. The dialogue went more or less like this.

"It appears our target got his... just deserts."

"..."

"I'm sorry, I dont know what came over me."

"You're right though. This is one hit wont be losing a wink of sleep over."

"l never knew felt so strongly about corporate embezzling."

"Not that. Whoever mixes High Chinese decor with a Persian rug deserves what's coming to him."

"Ugh! Shoot him again!"

&nbsp;

Oh wow this thread is still up. Might as well wedge in a couple more of my favorite Krane Brother moments.

&nbsp;

We were playing out one of those infiltrate the fancy party scenarios. Niles (my friend) had joined another one of our guys in luring a target (an orc) into a wine cellar so we could kidnap him. They failed in knocking him out stealthily and he fought back. Went into a berserk rage, punched Niles into a pile of barrels and got the other guy in the choke hold.

"Grk! Niles! Use magic!"

"l don't think my brother has disabled the anti-magic generator yet."

"Hit him, then!"

"l dont think he'll even feel it..."

"Hit him with a wine bottle!"

"Oh! Good idea!"

His player rolls to find wine from a subpar year, before bashing the orc With it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Another was later in that campaign when we got into a firefight with some Mutri (Bulgarian mobsters). After killing the mobsters, I started undoing the dead boss's belt.

"If wanted him so bad, could have merely wounded him."

"Oh ha ha! I'm simply trying to get the man's belt!"

"Really, Frasier? You're resorting to thievery, now?"

"For God's sake man, he's wearing a brown Armani belt with black shoes! BLACK shoes, Niles!"

"Unforgivable. "

"There, there, little one, you're safe now I have the perfect set of brown loafers to pair you with at ho- wait. This isnt real leather! It's a knock-off. have been deceived!"

"Just like that waitress fancied on our assignment in Thailand. What was his name again?"

**The Legend of Sir Bacon**

&nbsp;

So my players are travelling through some mountains and encounter an ogre. Among the ogre's loot sack is a live pig. They decide to take the pig with them for companionship and possible food. After a while they forget about the pig as it really doesn't add much. After slaying a dragon and looting it's horde I roll up a Headband of Intellect which the two spell casters begin arguing over.

&nbsp;

**Wizard**: I should get the headband as I have the most need for it.

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: I should get it because you already have enough intelligence.

&nbsp; 

**Wizard**: My spells are more powerful.

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: Mine are more versatile.

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: Give it to the pig.

&nbsp; 

**Party**: What?

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: Give it to the pig and stop arguing.

&nbsp; 

**Wizard**: But...

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: But...

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: \*takes the headband from them and gives it to the pig.\*

&nbsp; 

**Pig**: Hello, companions.

&nbsp; 

They ended up training the pig as a fighter, commissioning it some armour and now Sir Bacon is a proud and loyal member of they party.

Once, we had an elf who fucked one human, once, and developed this psychotic obsession with bringing him back to life after he died.

&nbsp;

She sort of faded into the background after a while, we forgot about her, but two campaigns later her research started popping up, and this escalated until it turned out that she was basically getting ready to harvest all life on Earth to try and bring her pet goldfish back to life. ay the end of it were were up to our balls in hideous soul-stealing goblin mutants that ate souls and vomited them back up as pearl catalysts for some ancient resurrection ritual.

&nbsp;

Five fucking campaigns of fighting this insane elf, motivated by love and heartbreak to destroy the world and overthrow the will of the gods to bring her husband back, because SOMEONE just HAD to hit on the elf chick.

&nbsp;

Way to fucking go, Riley.

You say that now, but you'd be eating your thumbs by the end of it. It's so enraging to go through these enormously fierce trials, and then realize that they arent clever at all, they were just engineered by a woman with infinite time and no sense of proportion.

&nbsp;

Example: Her research notes were all written in Dwarvish, which was the language of choice for scientific notation. aut then apparently she thought "oh hey, someone might read my notes and figure out my plans."

&nbsp;

Now a sensible person might start writing in code. She destroyed the entire Dwarvish civilization, and annihilated their culture. Then she invented Esperanto and taught it to the humans. Nobody speaks Dwarvish except her anymore. Fucking unbelievable. THIS WAS A WHOLE CAMPAIGN.

**Anonymous**, 06/02/2012, 06:24

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. The whole affair is just so agonizing from start to finish that it hurts just thinking of it. 

&nbsp;

Like in campaign three, when she introduced a wonder-crop that was like a combination between Potatoes, Wheat and Rice. Grew in huge paddies, each one was the size of a bowling ball, you could take in five crops a year easy, didnt deplete the soil, and, oh yeah, after the tenth year they basically flooded the atmosphere with sentient anthrax, to induce migration inland. YAY.

&nbsp;

Or like in campaign two, when she tore open the abyss with a huge ring painted with seven hundred gallons of her own blood carefully extracted and frozen over the course of decades, and used it to suck out the very spirits of entropy and chain them to her will so that she could put out the sun for the fifteen minutes she needed to do some stupid syzygy shit. No no, not because the sun needed to vanish for the alignment herself, she just wanted better lighting to see the stars. Not like she couldbe just used a telescope or anything.

&nbsp;

Every fucking time, we end up dealing with this hideous series of catastrophes, and a campaign later we realize just how trivial the actual motivations behind them were.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In his defense, this all started because we foreverDM'd him. Not exactly subtle revenge. I mean at least it's still fun, and while you're playing it you never notice, but then afterwards you're left going "did we just spend six months cockblocking an elf?"

&nbsp;

And the answer is yes. Six months cockblocking an elf. There was sentient anthrax and bandersnatches involved, sure, but when you get down to it it was cockblocking an elf.

This was a wrap up for a module we were playing, but I had fun the whole way. I played Krod, the half orc rogue... with a flail. Because in pathfinder, just about any weapon can get sneak attack damage. Krod is over 7 feet tall and speaks in the third person whenever he thinks someone is watching (Said to the Paladin: "Krod suggest you look other way while he shopping"). He wasn't dumb, but people never expect the idiot to be running a crime ring.

&nbsp;

Krod was a good stealth guy, but he shined in intimidation (+13 at lvl 3). This made for great moments as the game went on. The first time he was sneaking around, I fumbled his stealth roll. I looked at the GM, "Krod rears up and screams at the top of his lungs, 'YOU NO SEE KROD!'". I critted the roll. According to the GM, I stunned all the goblins there except for one who immediately went back to doing what he was doing previously and desperately tried to pretend I was not there. 

&nbsp;

That was Krod. One of his quotes was, "Only two things see Krod: dead things and things that know better than to admit it."

&nbsp;

So at the end of a module, my group is breaking up a local cult and we get caught in the middle of the leadership while trying to steal incrimenating documents. So we fight and against all odds defeat the leadership and their "Mask" golem (it helped when Krodd kneecapped it with a "sneak attack" with his two handed flail). Krod's standing over the cult leader and the guy give his BBEG last words.

&nbsp;

BBEG: I should have known you were unbelievers from the start!

K: *Shrugs* Krod always consider self militant agnostic. Krod not really know what to believe. *Hefts Flail* And he is VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT!

&nbsp;

CRUNCH. Good old Krod.

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2013, 20:07

Still, one of my favorite moments was when I had to ad lib a distraction. The group had infiltrated the earlier mentioned cult and were being processed. Our mage wanted to sneak off to check on some enchantment or another and I volunteered to keep their attention. The GM smirks and says, "Okay, what do you do."

&nbsp;

Me: Krod tells an entertaining story to distract the Acolytes.

GM: Okay... tell me a story. No roll. Tell me the story.

&nbsp;

Challenge accepted.

&nbsp;

Me: Okay, Krod gets them talking about themselves and eventually says "Krod had lots of jobs before coming here: Bouncer, bodyguard, gigolo, city guard"

GM: Gigolo?

Me: *Nods* "Yup, Krod was kept man for noble lady. She get off on Krod not being fancy. Krod had to quit though."

GM: One of the acolytes says, "Why did you quit?"

Me: "Fancy pants suitor get mad at Krod for taking his woman. Challenge Krod to duel. Then Krod kill him."

GM: "And she kicked you out?"

Me: "No, Nobel Lady get off on that too. Police get real mad though."

GM: "But duels are legal."

Me: "Yes, but only if you kill man during the duel."

GM: "...you killed him outside of the duel?"

Me: "Fancy Pants tell Krod to choose weapon! Krod choose surprise!"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2013, 19:47

Oh Krod had a lot of fun in a short set of campaigns. At one point, Krod is hanging with his group as we travel by river. When the GM notes we are passing another boat, he asked us where we were. I said Krod was in the Crow's nest. 

GM: The boat is too small, there is no crow's nest.

Me: ...he built one.

GM: He can't build a crow's nest.

Me: I haven't chosen a craft skill yet. "Krod is carpenter in free time. He enjoy working with hands in way that doesn't require he put down tarp."

GM: *Sigh* you have no tools.

Me: Krod glares at some spare planks and they know better than to not be a crow's nest. I roll to intimidate the wood!

GM: ...roll it.

&nbsp;

Krod now has the craft skill: Angry Carpenter.

It's true, good feels aren't as entertaining. I'll share one I guess, to help along.

&nbsp;

I first started playing D&D with my brothers and a few close friends in grade school, so young I don't actually remember when. To me it was just something to do with my cool older brothers. My favorite character back then, because I was just a kid, was an insane elf wizard. I played him as having been driven mad by a demon that tormented him in his youth, then let him lose as a joke. Of course I was just a kid, so this was hardly serious roleplay; he was lolsorandum crazy, not legit crazy.

&nbsp;

So one of my brothers was playing a paladin whose high CHA had made him the party face. We're in this fuck-huge swamp swarming with lizardmen trying to make our way to the central temple when we get jumped by a whole tribe of the fuckers. Paladin steps up to negotiate. Turns out they only speak draconic.

&nbsp;

Guess who is the only one who speaks draconic.

&nbsp;

My older brother turns to my kid self - an immature child playing as a batshit insane wizard remember - with just this absolute grimace contorting his face. "OK kid. You tell them EXACTLY WHAT I SAY." He was hoping to get his CHA bonus in there somehow by sort of leading the negotiations. I’m like, “OK bro.”

&nbsp;

"We just want to pass through, no trouble."

I turn to the DM. "He says he's here to woo your best lizardgirl."

&nbsp;

Brother's eye is twitching. DM is laughing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:40

The point is that having a story of a good memory that is told well is rare, because of how difficult it can be to make it engaging for readers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:38

Turns out this lizardman IS a girl, you can’t tell with these things. She gets all surprised, looks around. She says that’s her, since she’s the biggest and the strongest.

&nbsp;

My older brother is trying his hardest to stay in character. “What did it say?”

&nbsp;

“Sh, it’s a girl.” I try to look all wise, nod thoughtfully. “She says to prove yourself you have to perform the dance of peace.” Brother’s face is straight up convulsing. I’m looking cool. “It’s a lizardfolk tradition. You’d know about it if you’d studied, like me.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:38

“Tell it – I mean her. Tell her that I will gladly do what is required to prove ourselves peaceful.”

&nbsp;

I turn back to the DM. “He says he can prove his love through the medium of dance. He wants to dance with you.”

&nbsp;

And that’s how we partied with the lizardmen in the swamp, neither side having any idea what was really happening but the kid. I loved those days. I was a lot younger, so I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with my older brothers. It was nice of them to include me at all.

&nbsp;

Oh I guess I also tricked the rouge into performing ritual combat at dawn for the chieftess’s hand.

Guys did I ever tell you about the time I completely accidentally ruined a professionally made campaign for Dungeons and Dragons thanks to a single roll

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**calibrate**

Please explain 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**number-one-chiquita-dave**

Ok so we had to fight our way to the bottom of a castle to stop a group of cultists from summoning an Orc god to the world and we got there and the ritual was already going so I ran up to the god, who had already begun to manifest, and cast Finger of Death, which kills any target I touch if they fail a Fortitude roll. Since he was a god, he had a good constitution and would have certainly survived

&nbsp;

Except the DM rolled a 1

&nbsp;

and the god exploded

I'm proud to say that my Paladin once committed Orc genocide, by creating concentration camps where Baleful Polymorph was cast en masse to turn them into harmless animals, birds and doves to give them 'new lives' freed from their cursed bodies. 

&nbsp;

We actually turned into a religion, where orcs would strive to make themselves sufficiently pure to ascend. Since we'd already killed off all the warriors and the orc priesthood in the crusades, there was no one to turn them back: And accordingly to the rules for Baleful Polymorph, you lose your mind permanently if you fail a Will Save, which was mathematically impossible for these 0-level NPCs to pass. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, they built a statue of my character, in marble. In one hand, he takes the hand of an orc child. In the other, he holds a dove, symbolizing the promise of rebirth.

&nbsp;

He also has a huge, shit-eating grin.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Actually, we never killed anyone. 

&nbsp;

Not a single innocent was harmed. We could not kill women and children, even if they were orcs. 

&nbsp;

The solution, instead, was deemed incredibly humane, farsighted, and it looked really pretty. (i.e. The visual symbolism of a huge crowd of orcs become a huge cloud of doves.) 

&nbsp;

It was also amazingly evil, and my character loved it because he hated their entire race.	

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Probably, but - Here's the thing - we didn't force the change on them. The whole idea was that people would WANT to be changed.

&nbsp;

How did we do it? Well, we insisted on humane treatment for the orcs. We set up camps, made sure they were well-fed and clean, had Paladins sweep the place to make sure there were no abuses.

&nbsp;

And then we began to indoctrinate them. We told them that orcs are cursed, because their gods made them evil and twisted. But not to worry: If your heart is pure, you can transcend. You can become more, and live a pure, innocent life. (As a bird/fish/rabbit/whatever, but we universally did birds.)

&nbsp;

Every few months, there would be a Festival of Ascension, where orcs would be transformed en masse. It was a privilege! You had to be on your best behavior, and the camp counsilor had to go "Yes, he's been sufficiently redeemed. He can Ascend now."

&nbsp;

Can you see the beauty of this? We were teaching them to embrace their own annihilation. If any of them failed to transform, or transformed then changed back, we would welcome them back to the nearest camp, and tell them gently: "The path of ascension is not an easy one. It is good that you came back, so we can begin again. Not everyone makes it the first time, but we are here to guide your steps along the True Way."

&nbsp;

Basically, we made them WANT it. We made them WANT to become mindless animals. And I don't think the DM cottoned on to how insidiously evil this was, because I always pitched it as a shamelessly good act. No hypocrisy, my Paladin actually fought racists who wanted to exterminate them, gave passionate speeches about how "Orcs are not *evil*. They are a misguided people, formed by a cruel god. But we do not have to treat them the same way! We can uplift them, give them new lives beyond the misery of their bodies! We can make them pure!"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Exactly. You know what the biggest uproar in the camps were? Bribery, because orcs were paying to BE THE FIRST IN LINE.

&nbsp;

There was a riot, because the orcs wanted to BE CHANGED FIRST.

&nbsp;

It's like if people actively fought to be gassed. Each time, the guards had to restore order, and there were complaints about "Why does the criteria for Ascension have to be so stringent? Can't we allow more of them to be transformed? Our God is a forgiving God, after all."

&nbsp;

After a whole conclave was assembled, we eventually concluded that orc children were born free of original sin, and could be immediately ascended. However, we needed the consent of their parents, and at least three people to vouch for the character of their orc parents. 

&nbsp;

So this is how it feels like to be Double Hitler.

The generation of gravity from the skeletons' ever increasing mass sucks them into a void of density instantly killing anyone left on the planet who wasn't already dead...or a skeleton. This stans a chain reaction with fuels the creation ofa new star. A star born of death. The cries of many are lost to a burning blaze in the aether Some say you can still hear the rattling of bones echoing around this star.

Tongue in cheek. This shot campaign is affectionately referred to in our group as "Mr Bone's wild ride"

Here's a story about how the very first pathfinder game of our game went down, roughly 6 years ago.

&nbsp

>continent is being invaded drow and a bunch of weird aberrations

>shit is immediately getting fucked, our party is a drow, a magus (me), barbarian, gunslinger and a cavalier

>we're going around trying to figure out what's going on, apparently the invaders are wanting to destroy these 'seals' around the continent which keeps their deity powerless

>they've recently broken the first seal

>oh and by the way, when they do that it's the literal equivalent of a magical nuke

>yeah

>it's obviously a serious situation and we're working with THE GOOD KINGDOMT to not die horribly

>we're actually making progress, save some elf priestess for some reason .I don't remember what exactly, but the tables were finally turning, the court wizard trusts us

>except for the fact that the gunslinger killed the drow and got shanked by my magus but nevermind that

>suddenly, as we come back from our latest assingment, the guards of the palace tells us to fuck off

>our services no longer needed, we have crossbows pointed toward us

>we say fuck that, converse with them and do a bit of digging

>apparently every single noble house decided to backstab one another in an autistic play for power, and since we weren't in on it, we shouldn't get involved

>this is the part were i remind every one of you that the continent was literally being nuked and we're the only people that actually had any sort of success against the invaders

>swiftly chased our of the palace under bolt fire

>party manages to retreat into the wilderness, takes several minutes to process what happened

>we no longer can assist the kingdom reliably due to losing all of our contacts, and everyone sans the cavalier doesn't even want to help them at this point after that

>drow (who was revived) awkwardly mentions he was a double agent, and suggest we could just join them instead

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>me and the barbarian basically just say: "that's cool, but no thanks"

>cavalier just manages to go "well you are bad man and i will face you, but not now" (Mind you, the cavalier was an excellent player, but not even he could rationalized what just happened to us)

>the party quite literally sort of gives up or splits

>me and the barbarian just outright leave for an isolated continent

>drow fully joins the bad guys

>cavalier remains in his stalwart crusade, with the DM implying him and the drow would fight in the end

>they didn't because after that split nothing else happened, since there was no more campaign to run, and the DM couldn't be assed to run said battle

>oh, and the gunslinger was still dead

&nbsp

It really was weird how everyone just kind of lost interest the moment that 'power play' happened. It made absolutely no sense, and none of us can rationalize why it happened to this day.

>dreams tell him to go off on an expedition to find... something, he's not sure. But his dreams always turn out to true so he doesn't question it

>Teams up with his former manager/promoter bard and an elven rogue tagalong because they need a guide through the wilderness

>a jittering, rambling drunk who needs his handlers with him at all times, still prone to bouts of rage

>still hits harder with his fists than the bard does with his mace

>also now he can read minds and inflict nightmares on people (Dark Tapestry is fucking awesome)

And the best part is, he's still the party leader through charisma and force of personality.

Identity death was actually what drove the BBEG of one of the campaigns I was on. 

&nbsp;

It was a game with the house-rule that strong curses can't EVER be broken, which adds a degree of tension to even joke curses like Opposite Gender. 

&nbsp;

The BBEG used to be a Neutral Good Fighter that lived to help others and dreamed of being a great hero one day. He formed an adventuring party to try to stop an evil wizard, and was able to do a lot of great things. The final battle between him and the wizard, however, ended with them both being cursed with Opposite Alignment thanks to a gambit of the wizard's backfiring; the Wizard went from Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good with his memories of the atrocities he inflicted on his enemies in the name of his own ego, while the Fighter became Neutral Evil despite having a lifetime of memories of helping others out of the goodness of his heart. 

&nbsp;

The Wizard, now seeing his old self from a new perspective, couldn't live with the guilt and killed himself, but the Fighter spiraled downwards, remembering a lifetime of being good but cursed to be unable to understand WHY any of it mattered to him. Even trying to act on his memories didn't work, because the curse COMPELLED him to remain Neutral Evil. The cognitive dissonance eventually drove him completely insane; he went full evil warlord to try and kill the memories. By the campaign, he was so far gone he mistook our party's paladin for his younger self and became obsessed with fighting him. We didn't find out until much later in the campaign why he kept screaming at Pally to "tell him why" every time we fought him.

You know what? If someone wanted to try this I would let them. But you are looking at max dex of -4, maybe 5. 0 AC and 5 foot max speed. 

&nbsp;

But if you really wanted to waddle around as ball of twine man, sure go for it. You will look sily and not be that effective but what the hell people do retarded shit all the time. It would only take a few enemy hits to cut through your rope armor anyway.

Marge Dooley, aka Literaly Satan

I used her three times, one in each game. What I intended to be just an elderly named NPC with an angry and confrontational demeanor, ended up being the finger of death for all my campaigns.

&nbsp;

First time, she kills all PCs on account of bullshit luck, the players attempting to murder an old lady and shotguns being more powerful than initialy thought. Second time, I put her as a background NPC to get a reaction out of some returning players. The newbie looking at them overreacting decided to take a shot at her at his confusion, misses, kills a policeman and then the encounter goes tits up, they get caught in the crossfire and die. Third time is just unfathomable. This time I put her in a Dark Heresy game, completely unrelated, but described with the same demeanor, same rickety build and purple sweater, but in a different universe. It would be funny, until we noticed something.

&nbsp;

Every time someone attacked her, they missed. Every time an explosive was to go up near her, it ended up being a dud. All out of luck. From that point forward, the players took her along and she followed them for a good 5 session, while remaining unharmed, unfazed and just grumpy. Eventually, it's final boss time. They load her with some heretical psycher fueled proton pack I can't remember the name off to fire at a very depowered Lord of Change from a distance, with a faint hope of her fucking up. She managed to resist posession with a shitty 5% chance of making it twice. The old bat was made of iron.

&nbsp;

A few misses after it gets to a couple hitpointts and it turns that Marge is going for the ultimate kill steal.Then someone offhandidly mentions "at least she wont kill us this time". Then the weapon hits a random AoE attack. 38 damage to all. None survived. Third TPK.

&nbsp;

At that point and after a solid minute of silence, I muster a "Marge Dooley enters whatever hellportal she came out of and leaves us forever."

&nbsp;

I've never used her again

I dare not to

The people in a world with medieval stasis where advanced machinery is halted by the will of the gods or whatever is a depressing setting. They make the usual post apocalyptic settings look like a cheery land of hope and promise, where people might one day rise from the ashes, rebuild and rise from the radioactive ashes to ascend to the stars. So what if the dragon is slain? The guys in medieval stasis land, its' nothing but an endless series of pointless wars, scheming nobles, poop in the streets, toil and drudgery in pre-industrial savagery from now until the local star Novas or whatever the local equivalent is.

>Shane the Shy: The most infuriating boss ever

Many games have recurring villains. Sometimes these are minor enemies that you enjoy fighting, sometimes they’re an incredibly powerful boss that tests you then lets you live for inscrutable reasons, and sometimes its because they are very, very hard to kill. Shane was one of the latter sort and he was the most infuriating and unsatisfying enemy I’ve ever fought, because he had just about the best survival trait an evil character can have. He wasn’t invincible, he wasn’t prescient, he didn’t have some magical immortality, he didn’t even have some sort of amazingly competent henchman. What Shane had was Cowardice.

You may complain about how the villain is monologuing too much, or how he's too strong to fight, or how his behavior makes no sense. But take it from me, it's far preferable to an enemy that just fucking runs away the second you get close

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:03

Paranoia and Cowardice are survival traits, and if the enemy survives you didn’t win, there’s no second place in boss fights. We all laugh at the big guy chasing the small fast one around yelling ‘Fight fair!’, but it is just so goddamn infuriating when YOU’RE that guy. There’s nothing quite as bad as getting within an inch of success, then having it all just evaporate and start over again.

We first encountered Shane when looking for some work as newbie adventures. He hired us to look for some old records books in an abandoned and overrun garrison post. We went over, killed the local monsters, found the books, inspected them to make sure they weren’t actually Tomes of Evil World Ending Magic (they weren’t), then turned them in and got paid. It was a perfectly normal low level fetch quest, and between our other adventures he offered us more contracts almost exactly like it. We kept doing them (it was a good way to shake out new characters), bringing Shane a steady supply of old record books, heirlooms, and art pieces, until one day when he said he was done and left the city. A few weeks later the entire nation devolved in a civil war centered around a bunch of dukes pushing the claim of a previously unknown heir to the kingdom.

We fought in the war long enough to establish that both sides were utter assholes and that this sort of soldiering was a lot more likely to get us killed than get us rich, then skipped off for a more stable country to hang out in. Now we’d all been at this long enough to suspect that the documents and such that we had been gathering were the cause of the war (and a little ‘research’ confirmed it), but we didn’t put Shane down as anything but a procurer for the asshole dukes. He confirmed this when we met him again in the next country and offered us a job finding some magical objects while we got back on our feet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:04

Since Shane had never screwed us on a job we didn’t really have anything against him personally. He made a pretty good case about just being a middle-man and assured us that there was no way that anything we were getting for him this time could be used to start a civil war, so we took the job. Once again we verified that we weren’t fetching anything overly nefarious then turned the stuff in and got paid, this time it was just magical artifacts used for agriculture. Between bouts of serious questing we kept doing these little fetch missions for agricultural artifacts until one day Shane told us his contract was finished and he moved on again. When we came back from our mission to kill some evil wizard off in the boonies we found the entire country suffering from a famine due to some sort of magical invasive plant species.

We helped the locals hunt down a bunch of nutty druids who were using the artifacts we found to help grow the plants and put Shane on our ‘to-do’ list. We figured that two nation level disasters in a row were a bit much to put down as coincidence. Innocent middle-man or not Shane was not good for the general health of the world. So when we got to the next country and Shane once again offered us a job, we went to his new office planning to interrogate and kill him. Unfortunately the second we started to get unpleasant he hit a panic button, jumped out the window, and ran faster away than any of us could follow.

We tracked him to a mansion and made another attempt, except this time there were some pretty nasty evil goons to fight us. We fought our way through them to his rooms, where we expected some sort of monologue about his nefarious plans and a battle where he proved to be far more powerful than he looked. Instead we found an open escape passage to the now empty stables.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:08

We weren’t able to track him this time, and anyway we had some far more serious problems to deal with, but he was on The List. As soon as everything above him on The List was taken care of we were going to go wreck his shit, and after a few sessions it was. So we started looking, but it’s really quite hard to find someone who knows he’s being hunted and isn’t doing anything obviously nefarious. We could sort of track him by the chaos he caused, we got to the point where we just assumed that any plague / war / famine / magical disaster was caused by him. The problem was that he always left before everything went to shit and nothing he did was obviously evil, hell all he did in one nation was start a gold rush. No one thinks of an enthusiastic prospecting firm as an evil doom cult, that is until a Red Dragon shows up to take ownership of the newly wealthy nation.

The problem with following Shane around was that we usually wound up sorting out the current mess while he went and got started on the next. He was like the dickish in game embodiment of a DM, planning the next encounter while we took on the current one. Even when we sorted things out quickly (or occasionally just ignored them) and correctly guessed where he went next the second he noticed us getting close he would just abandon everything and change his identity (he’d also usually set up something nasty for us on the way out, like assassins or a nice framing). It was infuriating chasing him, and it was even worse when we got close.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:09

We actually caught up with him a few times, but the bastard was paranoid as hell and always seemed to have one more escape route than we planned for, and he was retardedly fast and stealthy. After everything was over we looked at his character sheet, the DM was keeping him leveled with us and he was a multi-classed character focused on nothing except Running, Hiding and Using Items. The only things he used offensively were several ranks of Knowledge and some Diplomacy skills. Any single character in our group could have easily killed him if we could only catch him, but we couldn’t; his complete abandonment of any offensive abilities meant that he was always faster and sneakier than us.

Finally to top it all off, almost no one would believe us. Everyone thought we were a bit crazy (and to be fair, some of us were), and didn’t believe us when we insisted that EVERYTHING that went wrong was the indirect result of Shane. We knew it was though, no matter how many party members died and got replaced, the party as a whole always knew it was all Shane’s fault. So we chased him, and had adventures, and chased him, and saved the world, and chased him, and chased him some more. Until one day we got access to Time Stop.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:12

We had been waiting for this for a long time, we had planned for this day so hard it was incredible. The war chest we had assembled JUST for killing Shane was enormous, and we used it all. We hired thieves, we hired wizards, we bribed guards, we called in every divine favor we could, we even made deals with the evil doom cults that Shane might work for. The Paladin was ready to fall, the Warlock was ready to repent his sins and seek redemption, the Bard was ready to swear of women and wine, whatever the hell it took to nail this slimy bastard to the wall.

We tracked him down by waiting for the next disaster to strike, then ignoring it and watching all the nearby nations for low level adventures being hired to collect things or new businesses opening. We noticed a major city that had started building more flammable industrial buildings than usual and some adventurers collecting some weather control artifacts. We knew he was planning some sort of giant fire or something and didn’t give a shit, all we cared about was making sure it took long enough for us to catch up to him. 

We had middle-men hire other middle-men to hire the best thieves to follow these adventures and figure out where Shane worked, then where he lived. Once we knew that, we got the best casters we could to feel out his magical defenses and help set us up to counter them when we went in. Sure we could have just had everyone nuke the place into the ground, but we had to be CERTAIN he was dead and not just hiding through a portal or something. We were going to kill him where we could see it happen and make sure it was done right.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:13

We went in through one of the escape tunnels while our hirelings covered every other exit or entrance we could find. We snuck up to the door to his room, blew it open, and had our caster use Time Stop. Shane had almost finished reading his own scroll of Time Stop (I can’t imagine the rage we would have felt if he had got his off first, I probably would’ve killed our DM). Our wizard dumped every magical restraint he could on him, and grabbed him for good measure. Then the rest of us came through the door like El Presidente’s SWAT Team and dogpiled the little fucker. We stripped him of everything he wore, then scanned him for magic, then ‘surgically’ removed a few things he was carrying INSIDE of him, healed him up and scanned again, then hit him with an anti-magic field then scanned again, removed the three things we’d missed of the first pass, then hauled him out of there.

We hauled him to a completely empty building outside of the city, only pausing to tell our minions to kill everyone inside, strip the place entirely, then level whatever they couldn’t take, and report to us at a location which we didn’t plan to actually meet them at, just in case they were followed. We used divine magic to make him tell the truth then got his entire story, along with complete lists of all his associates and the atrocities he had ‘facilitated’. Then we made a contract with the strongest devil we could handle to keep him from ever communicating with anyone in the afterlife, and to get him raped with spiky fucking dicks every fucking second of all eternity, and killed him. God that felt good.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/25/2014, 23:14

Then we went about dismantling everything he had ever done and wiping all records of him from existence, we didn’t even leave a body to bury. We sure as hell didn’t want some nutters WORSHIPPING him or trying to save him across time or something. We just wanted him gone, forever, there was no aspect of him which we thought should be remembered. Nothing about him justified ever, ever, mentioning him again. We deleted that fucker, made him an unperson.

He didn’t even have a good excuse for all the damage he caused, he was just a rich, bored, sociopath. It’s not like he had a evil divine mission or something, he just woke up one day and decided to dedicate his life to being a complete and utter dick to EVERYONE. He wanted to make as much overall suffering as possible, and decided the best way to do it was to sit there and help every little doom cult, or wannabe evil overlord, or rebellious noble carry out their stupid plans. He never personally killed anyone, he just arranged things. He was such a complete and utter tool that it took all the fun out of fighting him, and almost took all the fun out of killing him. Almost.

After we went full Inquisition on Shane we weren’t exactly popular, no one had believed what we said about the guy before, and now that he was dead we weren’t going to bother trying to convince them. We just left and started hunting down every name we got from Shane and fixing everything he had started setting up but hadn’t finished. After we got rid of the last Dread Overlord that Shane had helped set up and The List was empty we all retired and handed control of the party over to the apprentices that had helped us clean up the last of the mess. Things generally got better for the world, there was still shitty stuff going on, but it wasn’t quite as bad as it used to be.

So, while on watch, he talks with the cleric, and convinces him to try an experiment with the skeletons, a shit-ton of iron spikes and fifty feet of silk rope.

Teehee Maccaroni is the bane of my fucking existence.

&nbsp;

Every fucking campaign that my GM runs inevitably at some point involves running into an NPC named "Teehee Maccaroni," who the GM affectionately describes as "an epic level sorcerer who's also a retarded nudist gnome." 

&nbsp;

Teehee Maccaroni wander the countryside with a unique Rod of Wonders powered by "retard magic" shoved up his anus, and he casts the Rod of Wonders by diddling his penis. He says nothing but his own name in different inflections and the phrase "I like-a the goodberry, gimme gimme the goodberry." The GM thinks it's hilarious to have this character show up during the middle of encounters we're struggling at and start jerking off magic everywhere.

&nbsp;

But the worst part is his chant. He wanders around chanting his name, so when he's about to show up the GM will start low;

>Tee-hee-hee, Maccaroni Maccaroni

>Tee-hee-hee, Maccaroni Maccaroni

And then get louder and louder until he's fucking shouting

>TEE HEE HEE, MACCARONI MACCARONI!

>TEE HEE HEE, MACCARONI MACCARONI!

&nbsp;

And the table loves it! The other guys I play with think this is the best shit! Teehee Maccaroni has been our table's de-facto inside joke, our signature "running gag" for six years now. When that chant starts up, everyone else joins in like a ritual; the whole table is expected to start chanting "TEE HEE HEE, MACCARONI MACCARONI" by the end, and every fucking time I refuse because this is some embarrassing circa-2002 Penguin of Doom shit, it's always the same thing; "There goes Anon again! No fun allowed around Anon! Anon's just a big grouch who's getting angry because we're making him touch Teehee Maccaroni's penis again! Why won't you just let us have fun with this character, he's just here for dumb fun, you stick-in-the mud!"

&nbsp;

These motherfuckers are all over 25 years old.

&nbsp;

Teehee Maccaroni is going to be the death of me.

[*A part of adventurers consisting of an elf and two humans (one male, one female) are facing the door. One of them is picking the lock, and quick succeeds in opening the door. Upon entering they see that someone has painted the word "OVERTHINKING" on the wall.*]

[*The elf is dressed in robes suggesting he may be a cleric or wizard of some sort, the female human is wearing some kind of light armor (a breastplate would be my guess) suggesting she is some kind of fighter while the human male is dressed in plain clothes, and since he was the one who picked the lock, it is safe to assume he is some kind of rogue.*]

Elf: "Okay, so obviously it's a trap, but what?"

Human Female: "Does overthinking trigger the trap somehow?"

Human Male: "Is overthinking itself the trap?"

Elf: "If so, why would the trapmaster paint that warning?"

Human Male: "Or what if there's no actual trap? It's just the concept of a trap?"

[*The party all stare at the word looking confused and slightly annoyed*]

Alright, since I didn't see one, it's time for an awesome games thread.

&nbsp;

DM: Okay guys, time to start the game. What are you guys playing?

&nbsp;

>Friend: I'm playing a dwarven barbarian. He liked booze a little too much and got kicked out of his mountainhome.

&nbsp;

DM: Okay, sounds good. How about you, Anon?

&nbsp;

>Me: Well, ah, I also rolled up a barbarian. He's a human though, who's lived in the shadow of the same mountain his entire life but never knew there were dwarves there. That's how me and Friend 1 met.

&nbsp;

DM: Huh, okay. I guess we can make it work. And what about you guys?

&nbsp;

>Friends 2, 3 and 4 all look at each other.

&nbsp;

>Friend 3: Well, uh... we all rolled barbarians too.

&nbsp;

>The DM looks at all of us, then rifles through his notes for the next couple of sessions and throws away about half of it

DM: ...Well, gents, let's fucking do this.

&nbsp;

And so began our all-barbarian campaign.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 01:01

Well, since you guys asked... I'll start with a bit of backstory.

&nbsp;

These guys have been my friends for a long time now. They were the first people I ever played D&D with, and it had been quite some time since I'd roleplayed with them. So, when my friend who had usually been a player suggested we all try and play again, we jumped on the chance.

&nbsp;

There are six of us, including the DM. Me, who will be Anon for the purposes of this story, Friend 1, who shall be J, Friend 2, who shall be T, Friend 3, who shall be G, and Friend 4, who shall be M.

&nbsp;

Now, I was usually the one to play the DEX characters, rogues, rangers and the like, so I saw this game as a chance to change up my playing style. However, we're all pretty fucking bad at communication and we're pretty busy people, so we didn't really talk about the kind of characters we would be playing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 01:01

So the day finally rolled around, we all show up on time with our dice and our character sheets and take our seats around the table. After the shock of the initial realization, we laugh it off and start playing.

&nbsp;

DM: So the five of you are seated across from the Adjudicator of the city. He gazes balefully at you...

J: I'm sorry, but my character's INT score is 7. What do those words mean?

&nbsp;

We snicker.

&nbsp;

DM: Adjudicator is man who make law. Balefully is angrily.

J: Okay.

DM: ...shuffling a sheaf of papers between his hands. Looking at you again balef... er, angrily, he tells you that there are a number of criminals that need to be apprehended. He stands up and hands you the list.

&nbsp;

The DM gives me a handwritten list of names, descriptions, reasons for warrant, and bounty amounts. I turn it over in my hands, staring intently at the paper from all angles, then turn to the DM.

&nbsp;

Me: ....Thragmarr can't read.

&nbsp;

We all giggle again. The DM sighs.

&nbsp;

DM: So... who CAN?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 01:58

My apologies, this is set in 3.5.

&nbsp;

G raises his hand.

G: My character can. He has an INT score of 12.

We all look at him in disbelief.

G: It's true. His name is Ser Grogg, Esquire. He's a nobleman... of sorts.

&nbsp;

The DM puts his head in his hands.

DM: I REALLY should have looked over your characters beforehand, but all right. Continue.

&nbsp;

G proceeds to read out the list of criminals while we listen, completely enraptured by his ability to read, which is a foreign concept to all of our characters. After a bit of bickering, we decide the first person we're going to track down is a horse thief who's set up camp a few leagues outside of the town.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 02:24

Sorry this is taking so long, I'm writing from memory and I'm not the fastest typer.

&nbsp;

Fast forwarding a bit. After a long ride out to the hideout of the horse thief, during which we praised Grogg a lot for his astounding ability to read, we finally get to the cave system he'd been using (a little cliched, I know, but the DM is a fan of such things). We dismount, and after a few minutes of planning, decide that we're going to try and sneak up to the entrance.

&nbsp;

DM: Well, the thief has a couple of sentries posted.

M: Okay guys, I have an idea. Let's disguise one of us as a tree and sneak up on them.

We all agree this is a fantastic idea.

DM: Fine, roll then.

M rolls a disguise check, and we assist him, giving him a +4 to disguise himself as a tree. He rolls a 13, which gives him a 17 to the roll, making it a success. His roll to sneak, however, is another story; he rolls a 6, which takes a -2 because he's disguised himself as a fucking tree.

&nbsp;

DM: The sentries notice you.

M: I cast Sleep on them.

We all look at M like he's gone bananas.

J: You said you were a barbarian!

M: I am, just listen.

He then proceeds to tell us how his barbarian pulls out his arcane-carved stick, wave it around chanting nonsense for a few seconds, then point it at the two guards, shouting, "SLEEP NOW!" Both M's barbarian and the guards are perplexed; the barbarian because he doesn't know why the spell didn't work, and the guards because they don't know what the fuck is happening.

&nbsp;

So M's barbarian did the only thing a barbarian would possibly do in that situation: get frustrated and bash them over the head with his "wizard staff", knocking them out cold.

&nbsp;

[*To someone who asked why every storytime thread is so slow*]

I wasn't really expecting to storytime, I was just making a cool games thread.

&nbsp;

[*The story continues here*]

We love this turn of events, and even the DM cracks a grin at the creative roleplaying. We decide that there's no reason for us to even attempt to sneak around inside the hideout, and instead opt to break down the door. We cleave and bash our way through plenty of baddies, eventually reaching the chambers of the horse thief.

&nbsp;

DM: His chambers are draped in all sorts of cloth and chains, with arcane scrawls adorning the walls. There are books everywhere, and atop a tall pedestal a skull with a pentagram on the forehead glares down at you with a malevolent air.

He proceeds to read off a long, impressive speech by the "horse thief" about the coming of the end of all things. After patiently waiting it out, we initiate combat, quickly killing the fragile NPC, and hack off his head and thumbs.

&nbsp;

T: Okay, let's get out of here.

DM: But don't you want to look around some more?

G: We already got everything of value out of this place, let's just take off.

DM: But what about his books

Me: Dude, we're fucking barbarians. What the hell are we going to do with books?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 03:06

The DM huffs, but can't really do anything to stop us since he abhors railroading. So we strike back out towards the town, severed head and thumbs dangling in a sack off the side of the horse.

&nbsp;

Over the course of the game, which unfortunately only lasted about a two dozen or so sessions due to college getting in the way and respective jobs limiting our time, we collect each of these outlaws, and each time they have a pretty similar setup going on: a seemingly mundane criminal in possession of a great deal of magical items. And, each time without fail, our simple minds would miss out on the connection, get distracted by shiny things and other macguffins, and fail to notify anyone of import about what was going on in these lairs.

&nbsp;

But, I have to tell you, it was a hell of a ride. The dwarf was tossed on multiple occasions, and in one instance ended up inside the guts of a giant. He proceeded to hack is way up through his body, cut the heart out of it, and burst out of his chest, screeching, then take a tremendous bite out of the still-beating organ. We were all a bit more afraid of him after that. Probably my finest moment in combat rolling occurred during this campaign, too; we were fighting a group of Greater Barghests, and I had just been disarmed. Not about to lay down and let these things eat my face, I rolled a 19 on a Strength check to grab the nearest one by the tail and swing it about, bashing the other Barghests into the negatives. I wasn't content with just that, though; there was still one standing after that, so I rolled a motherfucking nat 20 and, in a scene straight out of Dorf Fort, tossed the Barghest through the other Barghest.

&nbsp;

But I digress.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 03:20

Despite our best efforts to continue meeting, the time finally came when our boisterous group of brawny barbarians was to disband. We'd proven our worth a hundred times over to the townspeople, so they were awarding each of us with a small parcel of land and a good deal of gold.

&nbsp;

Ser Grogg would finally be a real lord, with real peasants and real holdings, and Urist Meadbeard the dwarf could have his very own, genuine dwarven tavern to destroy every night in a drunken rage and build back up again in the morning. Thragmarr was not content to settle down, so he planned to sell the land, get an even bigger axe with the money, and find the legendary plane of Ysgard, where he could fight, drink, and wench for all eternity. He eventually got there, but that's another game entirely. Rolf became the most famous Muscle Wizard in the land, and planned to use his gold, land, and influence to start a school for his unique brand of magic.

&nbsp;

But fate, the DM, and our good friend J, had other plans.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 03:33

His grin was absolutely malicious as he sat behind his screen and described the calamity that befell us as we were awarded our holdings. It was as if he'd finally found a way to get back at us for derailing his campaign so completely, so spectacularly, that there was no way in hell he was going to finish it the way he'd planned to. So he decided to try and do the next best thing: Kill all of our characters.

&nbsp;

What it boiled down to was this: Each of the outlaws had been part of the same malevolent cult seeking to resurrect a forgotten beast which slumbered beneath the township. Its name had been lost to the ages, but pictures had survived, and some bright bulb decided he wanted to see this thing firsthand. Fortunately for us, the cultists had mucked up their spells without being able to figure out how to get the spell to activate. Unfortunately for us, behind our backs, J and the DM had conspired to make J the final piece of the puzzle, which would awaken the slumbering monster and (hopefully) kill us all.

&nbsp;

DM: As you stand atop the stage, cheering throngs of townspeople all around you, you're all suddenly jostled out of the way.

J: I shove the party aside and toss the mayor away from the pedestal. "Fools! You come here on this day for celebration. But I am here to tell you that this day heralds your doom!" With those words, I draw my longsword, and plunge it through my own heart, falling off the stage onto the ground in front of it.

&nbsp;

Our fucking faces when.

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 03:40

DM: "The ground quakes and begins falling apart, a great groaning and gnashing of teeth rising up from the cracking earth. Two hundred yards away, an entire section of the town disappears, sliding beneath the ground as something massive stirs. Moments later, from within the bowels of the earth, the Unnamed One rises, its many tentacles whipping about its head in a bloody frenzy as its eons-long slumber finally ends. The townspeople scream and panic, running in every direction in their primal fear. Women and children scream and cry, the old and weak are trampled underfoot, and men go mad at the sight of such a monstrosity. It opens its seven gaping maws, looses a mighty roar, and begins charging towards you.

&nbsp;

Roll for initiative."

&nbsp;

Again, our fucking faces when.

[*Picture of a surprised man*] 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 03:59

We all roll reasonably well. I get a 16, M gets a 15, G gets a 19, and T rolls a 13.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the DM knew we'd do fairly well on our initiatives, so to counteract the penalty to initiative that Massive creatures take, he stacked Improved Initiative on the monster something like five times, and it went first. Luckily, he gave us this round to prepare, as it would take at least two turns for the beast to get over to where we were. We went into a quick huddle, made our plan, and stood our ground against the charge.

&nbsp;

Have you ever imagined what it would be like to be beset upon by a kraken, when you're armed only with a greatsword of magic power and dubious origin? How about if that kraken was on land, could cast several level 3 spells as abilities, eschewing both materials and somatic components, and did 3d10+35 damage per swing? That's what it was like fighting this monster. I tell you, if we hadn't plundered an amazing amount of gold from each of the hideouts due to DM fiat in treasure generation, we wouldn't have stood a chance. As it was, we were getting pummeled, and we needed to end it fast. So T passes me a note. I look at him, and solemnly nod my head.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 04:04

DM: Anon, the round passes to you. What are your actions?

Me: I turn to Urist, who grabs my forearm as I grab his.

T: "I jest want ye to know, 'twas the greatest honor I ever knew fightin' alongside ye."

Me: I feel tears well up in my eyes, and I see them welling up in Urist's too. I hand him my Portable Hole, and he takes out his Bag of Holding.

T: "Now toss me, you sodding moron, one last time."

The DM looks stunned.

DM: Roll... roll strength.

&nbsp;

I rolled. I wish I could say it was a natural twenty, because by Kord, Urist deserved it. But it wasn't. It was a nineteen. With my strength modifier, and the feat from Complete Warrior that lets you toss things better, that added up to a 31.

&nbsp;

Me: I spin Urist around, tears streaming down my face into my beard as I do so, and toss him into the gaping maw of the Unnamed One.

DM: T, the round passes to you. You take 23 points of crushing damage and 47 points of acid damage, which brings you to three HP.

T: I put the Portable Hole in the Bag of Holding.

The DM looks at us, then at his notes, then leans back in his chair.

DM: A portal opens up, sucking you and the Unnamed One into the Astral Plane.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/24/2012, 04:11

We all passed our strength checks to avoid being sucked through, miraculously. Everyone was quiet for a few minutes after that. The DM looked as if he was cycling between pure, unadulterated fury and helpless adoration at the defeat of his BBEG. J just looked sullen; he wanted us to die with him, not defeat the monster in such an epic way.

&nbsp;

The town built a statue to memorialize Urist for his sacrifice. To this day, the township and the other party members like to think he's on some better plane, one with lots of booze and fighting. I know better though, because, as it turned out, he was.

&nbsp;

But, like I said before, that's a story for another day.

Hey /tg/, you guys up for some story time? Of course you are! This is just my experience with a freeform RP a while back, and I think it’s about time I share it. It’s been a long time, so sorry if some details are a bit hazy, but I remember the important bits. Behold, the Ballad of Edgardo!

&nbsp;

>Get a hankering for some RP, cruise a couple forums

>Something catches my eye

>Some kind of weird combination of stuff from Dragon Ball Z, Gurren Lagann, Avatar the Last Airbender, and a few other themes from different shows

>Basically animu: the game

>Honestly kind of a cool setting after reading through it. Super-powered dudes wander around doing their own thing, having adventures, and trying to stop evil “shadows” from consuming the world.

>Looks cool, sign up and start making a character.

>Characters had attributes (strength, speed, the usual shit), Traits/Powers chosen from a big list, and Spirit, which you used for doing cool shit.

>Had a certain number of points to spend on Attributes, maxed strength and put some into speed, endurance, and a couple in charm.

>Wanted to try a brawler type guy. I’ll get to why that idea was a bad one later.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:18

>Look at Spirit rules before picking powers, because I want to do as much cool shit as possible.

>Spend spirit to activate powers. Different Powers modified how spirit worked and gave it an elemental alignment, which modified damage and other crap.

>Basically let you spend 1 point of Spirit to get 5 points of fire damage. Neat.

>There was also “Raw Spirit” which had no modifier, but also no elemental alignment and couldn’t be resisted. Less bang for your buck, but could be useful.

>Raw Spirit could also be used to raise a stat temporarily, but the higher the stat the more Spirit you had to spend.

>Spirit had a cap depending on your attributes. At lower levels it was pretty low, like 10 or 20 if you got lucky.

>With my stat layout, I had 5. Awesome.

>Look through the powers list to see if I can unscrew my character.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:19

>Browse through list, pretty basic stuff.

>Throw fire, control shadows, frost breath, whatever.

>Also mundane “powers”, like sword fighting and free-running.

>Choose unarmed combat right off the bat, cuz I wanna punch people. Still a bad idea.

>Keep looking, see something interesting tucked away in the list.

>“Overflowing Spirit” Pretty expensive points wise for a simple power, but my eyes lit up at what it did.

>“Removes the spirit cap” (Plus some other crap which I glanced over at the time, but more on that in a bit)

>Oh fuck, now that’s pretty abuse-able!

>Figure everyone takes it, so I take it too.

>Take Battle Cry for a spirit buff and to blow the last of my power points.

>Character pretty much done, name him Edgardo because it sounded cool at the time.

>Ready to go, Edgardo the Brawler sets out on his quest to…do whatever.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:19

>Start in the central town where everyone else hangs out. Introduce myself

>Describe him as “Hot-blooded, hot-tempered, courageous, and always itching for adventure!”

>Honestly pretty flat character, but whatever, I thought he was okay.

>Promptly get laughed at for making such a “naïve and low brow character”

>Apparently everyone has made brooding anti-heroes who sit in dark corners and don’t really do much of anything.

>I swear the tavern had to be some kind of 8th dimensional shape, because EVERYONE was in their own fucking corner away from everyone else.

>But the last straw came from some asshole drinking his wine at the bar

>“Edgardo is such a stupid name anyway”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:20

>Motherfucker! Edgardo did NOT walk in here to be mocked by a bunch of trenchcoat wearing pricks that are trying to be edgier than a goddamn razor blade factory!

>Take a swing, and quickly discover that I am well and truly buttfucked.

>Apparently unarmed combat was hosed from the start, as fists don’t do shit against even the lightest armor, and don’t get damage multipliers.

>Fantastic

>Blow a Spirit point, just to get past his armor, do single digit damage.

>Fucker laughs and stands up “Care to try again, you pathetic wretch?”

>Use Battle Cry, can’t thick of anything so I go with “BANZAI!” and use the rest of my spirit points.

>Nothing. He dodges, draws his sword, and gives an eye-rolling “Disappear!” before he blasts me out of the tavern with sword-lighting-whatever-the-fuck.

>He spends one Spirit for that, and I nearly get one shot, even with a good amount of endurance.

>Fuckin’ what?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:21

>So, while I’m bleeding out on the side of the road, I take the time to browse some other characters.

>First up is sword lightning asshole. Basically the same level as me, but better in every way.

>Powers are better, higher spirit, good stats.

>More my fault really, cuz I fucked up character creation.

>Browse more characters, notice something.

>No one has Overflowing Spirit. No one.

>Ask why. Turns out that if you make a decent character, you have more than enough Spirit to do whatever the fuck you want. Even the highest level characters only have about 100 cap, and it’s rare to get halfway down in a normal fight.

>And then there was the part I skipped over.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:21

>Overflowing Spirit prevented you from taking elemental powers.

>You were basically stuck using Raw Spirit, which was shit.

>Elemental Spirit had damage modifiers so high that, even if you resisted it, you still took a good amount of damage.

>Neato burrito. Edgardo was basically useless against everything.

>Since I was screwed, I PMed a mod to see if I could make a new character that wasn’t crippled beyond belief.

>“lol, deal with it! u made it, you play it”

>So, recap. Everyone’s a pretentious fuckwad, the mods don’t give a shit, and Edgardo is beyond worthless. Great start.

>Pick myself out of the dirt and limp away to get myself healed. 

>Nope. I was broke, so I couldn’t get shit. I’d have to sit my ass down and wait to heal naturally, which would take days.

>Fuck that, I’m already tired of this shit, so I make an attempt to steal a potion

>Ahahahahaha no.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:22

>Enter Miltant Xer0

>Yes, that was his name. I cringed too.

>Omnipotent character #4782, could do anything he wanted because he had been with the RP the longest.

>I also suspect that he sucked the Admin’s dick, but whatever.

>Teleports to me instantly, I can’t do shit cuz I’m basically dead on my feet.

>Lifts me into the air with magic psychic bullshit, so I can’t even run

>He starts going on a long speech about crime and how evildoers should be punished and how he’s the best and blah blah blah

>Then he gives me an ultimatum

>“Beg me for mercy, and I might just let you stay in this town! Otherwise I’ll throw you to the shadows!”

>Fuck no! Edgardo does not beg!

>Struggle, swear, spit, and basically do everything I can to do ANYTHING to get out of this.

>Nope. I get thrown through the roof of the building I was in and soar all the way out into the wilderness.

>Well, I’m dead. Fortunately, newbies get one free revive. I cash mine in.

>Xer0 gets super fucking buttmad about it, says I’m dead for good because he says so and WAAAAH.

>Call him out on his bullshit, immediately get shot down by everyone in the community.

>Suddenly I’m the bad guy for trying to steal and picking a fight. Yeah, okay.

>Mods calm everyone down, say I’m alive with one health in the wilderness.

>Last bit of charity I’m getting. I won’t even survive the night.

>But then I met A Guy Called Squid

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>Beastfolk were a thing, so people could have cat-girls and wolf men and shit like that.

>A Guy Called Squid was, well, part squid.

>And yes, his full name was A Guy Called Squid, and he insisted that everyone called him that.

>Pretty cool dude, ran into the same troubles I did. Was a punchy guy like myself, but he punched people with fire.

>Helped me out, shared a potion, and was generally a bro.

>We both decided to stick together and train out here, because we both needed to get a lot stronger before we headed back into town.

>Still, we barely survived, mainly because Squid’s fire damage was beastly.

>We both agreed that we wouldn’t survive another fight like that, so we high tailed it out of there and back to town.

>Yeah, no. Invisible force shield prevented us from going back in. I wasn’t surprised.

>Looked on the map, found a nearby town to hole up.

>It’d take a couple of days to get there though, and we were both out of supplies.

>Neither of us saw any other way, so we got to walking.

>Edgardo and A Guy Called Squid, just two guys on the road to adventure!

>Or the road to not dying horribly and somehow getting petty revenge, but whatever.

>We saved a lady from bandits on the first day.

>And by that, I mean we kicked the bandits in the nuts, grabbed the lady, and ran like hell.

>That night she prison shanked Squid, took what little shit we had gathered and bailed. When I tried to chase her, she poofed. Gone.

>Neato burrito

>I really don’t know why we kept going after that. It was obvious we were unwanted, so we really should’ve just quit.

>Which gave Squid the perfect setup. He jumped on Sword-Guy, and blew all of his Spirit too.

>Where once there had been a face, there was now a smoking crater.

>Sword-Guy died, and to two underdogs to boot.

>Predictably, he pitched a bitch fit, and so did the rest of the players. We were murderers and outlaws and generally horrible, horrible people for deciding not to deal with this bullshit anymore.

>Me and Squid didn’t give a single fuck. We had earned our first actual victory! Sure, we were nearly dead, defenseless, and still had to make it to the village, but we won!

>Things were looking up, at least for a little while.

>And we still had to worry about Xer0 and his crap.

>Xer0 was some kind of king or tyrant overlord or whatever, and this village was still in his little “authority zone”

>So, when we finally arrive at the village, guess what special surprise is waiting for us!

>If you guessed invisible immune-to-everything force shield, congratulations! Give yourself a gold star.

>And for good measure, he teleports in and taunts us, saying he’ll follow us until we’re broken and mad and shut the fuck up already!

>He cackles and ports away, Squid falls to his knees.

>He’s had enough. We came all this way, all for nothing. Sure we beat someone, but he’d be rezzed and in perfect health the next day.

>“So what do we do now?” Squid was ready to quit. Edgardo wouldn’t have it.

>“We train Squid. We train.”

>We hiked up a nice, grassy hill near the village. And then proceeded to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.

>Whenever you got into a fight, you got a couple of points towards leveling, win or lose.

>The only problem is that most characters couldn’t spar against one another, as they’d kill each other pretty quickly. Elemental attacks and weapons combined had huge damage multipliers, so sparring would quickly end up with people dead.

>We didn’t have any weapons, and unarmed combat would take DAYS of wailing on someone to actually kill them. The only reason Squid was alright was because of his fire power.

>So, as long as we didn’t use any Spirit, we could beat each other silly, pass out, wait a while to heal, and do it all over again.

>It was stupid, it was cheesy, and it pissed everyone off, but it fucking worked.

>Some said that the shadows would attack us, but we were just close enough to the village that they couldn’t.

>I’m still not sure why Xer0 or even the mods let us get away with this shit. I guess they didn’t see it as anything to actually be worried about.

>Eventually we leveled up though. It was a slow process, and there were better ways of levelling, but this was all we had.

>Plus, it gave me another fuck ton of Spirit points.

>Edgardo pumped up strength first and evenly distributed the rest. Got a power to double the rate at which he gained Spirit per day. I had a plan.

>Squid just buffed his fire fists. It was a good way to go.

>Now we just had to find somewhere to rest up properly. Somewhere to regroup.

>We couldn’t just stay and wail on each other for another level. We had gotten lucky the first time, but now there was talk of a few other players jumping us. We had to move.

>Neither of us knew where the hell we were going or what we were doing. We just hit the road and tried to get as far away from Xer0 and everyone else as we could.

>The mods fucked with us for the first few days, but eventually they just got bored and left us alone.

>Sometimes they’d throw a few shadows our way, but it was nothing we couldn’t handle. Random events just stopped happening for us.

>I think it was mainly due to us not really bugging anyone anymore. We were doing our own thing, so everyone just sort of forgot about us.

>Except Xer0.

>He was still mighty pissy about me living this long. I have no idea what his deal was. Maybe it was just the challenge to his authority that I represented.

>Or maybe he was just a colossal prick.

>Either way, once we left his “authority zone” or whatever, he sent one of his lackeys after us.

>A quick look at his character sheet, and I knew just how much Xer0 hated us.

>His name was Goldnharl, and the dude was basically invincible.

>Magic armor let him resist all elements massively, plus it was super light so he could fly around and do his ninja-flippy shit.

>He could heal himself completely by spending a couple of Spirit, and his Spirit refreshed basically whenever he wanted it to.

>It was official, the mods just didn’t give a shit.

>Oh, and we were screwed too.

>All we could do was keep going forward and hope he didn’t catch up to us.

>He did, and damn quick too.

>He met us while we were traveling along a gorge, and promptly tried to knock me over the side.

>Goldnharl wasn’t fucking around. No words, only pain. He meant business. 

>I barely managed to dodge him (which was, of course, met with public outcry) but I was dangerously close to the edge.

>Squid tried a fire punch with a couple of Spirit behind it. No sell, and Goldnharl got a free counter attack because fuck you he’s Goldnharl.

>Squid is knocked down, but it gave me an opening. I grabbed Goldnharl by his waist and gave him a suplex. My high strength let me get in a few points of damage, and it put me in a better position.

>It didn’t really matter though, as he was back up and fully healed a second later. I helped Squid up, but we were pretty much already dead.

>Goldnharl finally spoke up. “Any last words?”

>“Banzai.”

>The fucker was wide open, and his back was at the edge of the cliff too.

>A quick PM to Squid was all it took, and the quick plan went off like clockwork.

>Squid ran diversion, going high for a fire punch to the face. Goldnharl didn’t bother to dodge. He was invincible after all. He forgot one thing

>Raw Spirit can’t be resisted.

>Edgardo went in for a gut punch, with all that built up Spirit from the training and the road. It wasn’t enough to kill Goldnharl, not by a long shot

>But it was enough to knock him backwards. And that last step was a doozy.

>Goldnharl fell down into the canyon, and we only stayed long enough to hear the dull thud of him hitting the ground.

>I could practically hear Xer0 grinding his teeth to powder as he tattled to the mods, who really didn’t care enough to do anything.

>Surprisingly, I barely heard anything from Goldnharl’s player. Just a simple PM saying “well played.”

>I almost felt sorry that he had to meet his end like that.

>After that, we were pretty much free to keep going until we hit another village.

>Xer0 couldn’t get to us here, so no shield and no bullshit. We could finally rest!

>Well, maybe. We were still broke.

>And there was a small army of players after us. Apparently Goldnharl was a pretty popular character, and by killing him we were now at the top of everyone’s hit list.

>Fantastic.

>Squid slept in an alley, and I kept watch, trying to get a plan together.

>We basically had come to a sort of unspoken agreement. Squid was tired of Xer0’s shit, and so was I. We wanted him dead and broken

>The problem was that two low level characters could do fuck all against the guy. His level was literally listed as an infinity sign.

>When Squid took watch, I read over the fluff of the setting, looking for something, anything that could help us.

>I found it in the city of Haven.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/11/2013, 17:31

>Haven was the second biggest city in the setting, just barely smaller than Xer0’s place. It was kind of a big deal though.

>See, it was home to the Spirit Well. It was a font of power that everyone flocked to. As long as you were in Haven, your Spirit points recharged instantly, up to your cap.

>I didn’t have a cap.

>I still wonder how anybody in their right mind missed this little detail of Overflowing Spirit. It was just set up so perfectly. Maybe I was being a massive That Guy for exploiting this like I did, but I don’t really care. Everyone but a few people were complete assholes, and I wanted their little club destroyed.

>It was petty, it was stupid, and it was probably hurtful to a few people. But Edgardo had a mission, and A Guy Called Squid was gonna help him see it through!

>If they ever got to Haven in one piece.

>I swear we were the only two people following the traveling rules, because the horde of players chasing us caught up to us a lot quicker than they should’ve.

>We had half a day to rest up before we had to hit the road again. I was useless without a build up of Spirit, and Squid could only fend off so many before he’d die.

>The only route to Haven was a long, winding road through the mountains, and we’d be ambushed if we tried to set up camp anywhere.

>It’d take to long, and time wasn’t on their side.

>So Edgardo had a crazy idea. What if they climbed over the mountains?

>It was basically suicide, as the random events were especially harsh in that terrain. No one would follow us. Aftter all, something might happen to their super speshul characters.

>Squid was on board, and he brought up an interesting point. The mods were ignoring us. 

>Everyone was so pissed off at us, but in the grand scheme of things, we hadn’t really done anything major. We killed a grand total of 2 characters through sheer luck and broken mechanics, and I had basically given their idol Xer0 a giant middle finger for simply surviving as long as I had.

>And Xer0 could only suck so much cock.

>So we started climbing, making rolls and getting through by the skin of our teeth. Every once in a while a mod would glance over and make shit hard for us, but overall we didn’t have that much trouble.

>That’s because trouble was waiting for us on the other side of the mountain.

>From our perch, we got a view of the players coming for us. There was no way we could take them all, and I we waited they’d just get to Haven and wait for us there.

>And then there was the guy waiting just underneath us.

>Goldnharl, back from the dead. They must’ve fished him out of the canyon and had him rezzed. Or maybe he survived the fall and healed. Who knows.

>We know he saw us, but he didn’t move. He could have just jumped up any time he wanted and murdered us right then and there. But he didn’t.

>After a while, Squid got tired of waiting. He climbed down, and Edgardo followed to have his back in case things went south.

>Squid asked him what he wanted. Goldnharl just wanted to talk. Turns out that he had more to his story than we knew about.

>Goldnharl was in this RP just as long as Xer0 was. And frankly, he was tired of Xer0’s shit. Goldnharl earned everything he had, and didn’t need to resort to whining to the mods to get what he wanted.

>When we asked why he tried to kill us, he said that it was either follow Xer0’s orders, or get his shit shoved in. In a one on one fight, Goldnharl just couldn’t compete, mainly because Xer0 could do whatever the fuck he wanted and no one batted an eye.

>After we killed him, he was basically done. He was satisfied with the ending he got, but instead Xer0 revived him and sent him to kill us again. Goldnharl had other plans though.

>Squid was suspicious, but I believed him. I’m still not sure why, maybe I was desperate, but I told him our plan.

>Technically I told everyone our plan, as it was in one of the public threads. I’m an idiot, sue me.

>We had to promise we’d kill Xer0 and end this once and for all.

>Edgardo and Squid agreed. This was our only shot, and we weren’t about to throw it away.

>A massive shitstorm erupted from the player base as we joined up with Goldnharl. Xer0 called him a traitor to everything the RP stood for, and everyone made such a fuss that the mods nearly banned the guy.

>Goldnharl had a bit of sway with the mods too, and he got lucky as shit when they took his side when he pointed out that he had done nothing wrong. 

>With the mods appeased, that just left the army of players gunning for us. The second we hit the road, they were on us. There was no fucking around anymore, and the travel rules were basically out of the picture.

>A horde of super-powered loners and misfits charged towards us, flinging fire and lighting and all manner of weapons. All of them driven by their singular hatred of Edgardo, A Guy Called Squid, and the traitor Goldnharl.

&nbsp;

>war-torn kingdom plagued by the activity of a Cult of Pain (mostly kidnappings)

>we track the cult to an underground city/temple complex

>it's populated by the cultists of a minor God of Pain

>through an unholy ritual their god blesses them with a bond which makes people share physical pain

>cult warriors can even conduct the ritual in battle, making an enemy share pain with them

>the complex is full of torture rooms and victims suffering as their torturers share the experience and revel in it

>we see cultists throwing some victims down DEEP rifts and then sharing the feeling of the deadly impact

>A THOUGHT OCCURS

>we kidnap two dozen cultists and their bondmates

>after some experimentation, it turns out the range on the bond ability is huge

>we travel to the capital to approach the king with a lucrative deal of building a very fast communication network (signals transmitted via torturing separated bondmates)

>along the way we're attacked by the cult leader, who's enraged at us making a mockery of his faith

>suddenly he's stripped of powers

>DIVINE INTERVENTION

>the God of Pain LOVES our idea

>as his newly appointed emissaries, we sign the agreement with the King

>cult gets criminals to torture for the communication network and maintains it in return

So yeah, we're now overseeing the construction of a torture-room "telegraph" network around the Kingdom.

Small time my friend. Small time.

&nbsp;

A buddy of mine went off to college a few years back and ended up sharing an apartment style res with four other gamers. At first they were pretty cool guys, until I was invited to game with them. The entire lot of them were THAT guys, playing anthromorphic characters, being chaotic randum, one player had a custom made vampire race that was stupidly OP and only had a LA of +1. Shit had to stop and I knew that it was my duty to stop it.

&nbsp;

I played a LE human wizard who specialized in the creation of magical items, his character concept was that wealth was often equal to power and what better way to make cash on the up and up then by creating and selling gear catered to adventurers and the elites. Another quirk of his was that he kept a grimoire on him in which he wrote the names of those he and the party had slain, if a name was unavailable he would write a brief description, approximate age, and location of death. Whenever they'd stop in a major city he would copy the most recent additions and deliver it to the mortuaries, as an act of respect to the dead. I actually made this book in RL, and filled it out after every fight.

&nbsp;

I went full out on this guy and regularly made the parties equipment for 3/4 of the cost it would have taken them to buy it, often giving discounts if it suited both of our needs for them to have the better gear. My only stipulation was that my loot be kept on me, and not with the parties funds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By the end of the campaign I was several levels under the party but had a huge stockpile of gold saved up to buy a nice island somewhere and live the good life. We finish off an evil draco lich that was bent on world domination and are about to go our seperate ways when the party barbarian stops my character and demands that I give them back the gold they paid for their equipment or he would kill and take it from me. I tried to reason with the rest of the party but they were all being greedy fucktards, It was four vs 1 and I wasn't allowed spells from outside the phb, so none of the fantastic bullshit of celerity could save me, and the barbarian would unquestionably beat me on initiative if it got to combat. Resigned to my fate I did the only thing I could do, and spoke to them one last time.

&nbsp;

"Lalilulelo" Our clerics armor suddenly burst into sunlight, the barbarians weapon animated and began to attack him, while his armor locked in place freezing him on the spot. The rogue was disintegrated on the spot as his gear spontaneously blasted him with magical rays.

&nbsp;

Within a round the party was dead or incapacitated, save for my character, who calmly approached the frozen barbarian as he was hacked apart by his own weapon, pulled out his book and flipped to one of the first entries. As I described this I pulled out my copy of the book, and did the same, turning it so that the rest of the table could see where there names had been scrawled on the day I had met them.

&nbsp;

"There was never any doubt in this outcome. I knew your greed would overwhelm you and took the necessary measures to stop you when it did. Perhaps if you had simply let me go things wouldn't have gone just as planned."

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/25/2011, 17:09

The table just kinda stared at me in silence. I didn't play a very talkative role in the campaign, and usually kept what I did separate from the party pretty brief. They hadn't even known my alignment, as my evil deeds were usually of the subtle sort, such as unfair contracts and manipulating the party into doing what I had planned. After the final fight I gathered the loot from the dracolich's hoard, including the materials and instructions required to make a phylactery of my own. The campaign ended with my character getting the credit for saving the continent and being lauded as a hero, the others were quickly forgotten, as I claimed that they had fallen under the influence of the dracolich and been destroyed. The only legacy they left were their names scrawled in my book.

The Helm of Count Brennox. 

&nbsp;

This odd-looking helmet was forged to look like the ever-grimacing face of the legendary Count Brennox. It is said that he had this helm made just so that he'd have no need of revealing his face to others again, and indeed, it was whispered that he had never removed this helm alongside his armor and regalia. But the truly odd thing pertaining to this helm is that the Count was seen in public far more often than before, whereas he had only gone out on his long nightly walks before returning to his manor in the past. Truly odd indeed!

&nbsp;

This helm grants the wearer an immunity to the effects of heat and fire from curses and self-inflicted spells. But why would the Count have need for such a thing?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/19/2016, 08:23

**Anonymous**, 08/19/2016, 10:38

I'm sure he suffered from photophobia, possibly as a result of Albinism, which also coincides with him hiding his face.

&nbsp;

Vamprism is just ridiculous, the count was an upstanding man. Why, my great grandfathers journal tells of the time where he bumped into the count by mistake and spilled the rice he was bringing home. The count not only help him recover it, but counted every grain to ensure none were missing.

Truely the Count is a fine man, for I heard that when a river broke its banks and covered the path is a small layer of water, enough to easily walk through, the Count immediately ordered his men to contract a Stone Mason to shore up the banks and prevent the flooding. The path outside the maiden Vimis's house was repaired in less than a day, whereas under our previous Lord we would have had wet feet for the entire Autumn.

[*Image of a gold ring.*]

My friend purchased a magic ring for 5gp, which the traveling salesman said had the power to make it look like his finger disappeared when he put it on. The novelty worked just as described, except that it didn't just look like his finger wasn't there, it truly wasn't.

&nbsp;

A little guesswork, and he decides it must be a fey ring, a tiny little portal to another dimension. Rolling up tiny pieces of parchment with letters on them, he would push them through the ring, and they would disappear. He would do this several times a day, for a week or so, but nothing would happen.

&nbsp;

Finally, a letter was sent back. A tiny little scroll that required a glass lens (which was rather expensive to purchase) to read, it rather rudely asked him to stop littering the fey's study.

&nbsp;

So, my friend decided to do what any intelligent person would.

&nbsp;

He threw the ring into the bottom of a lake.

&nbsp;

A month later, the fey kingdom is waging war on all humanity because the Queen of Fey's castle is completely flooded, and the merfolk tribes that lived within the lake are waging war because some foul sorcery has dramatically reduced the amount of water in the lake and continues to do so.

&nbsp;

Hundreds of people die or are enslaved each day, and no one seems to know where the source for all these troubles came from. Most people are blaming the druids, who are being hunted and killed, all while the sacred groves the druids were to protect are razed and destroyed by the supernatural war.

&nbsp;

Our adventuring party, deciding that we couldn't stand to see all this happen, moved into the next region, away from all the chaos.

To get the MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CAFFEINE, you will need to go to a DRINK MACHINE... Unfortunately, the only coinage it accepts are TUSK-TOKENS. Perhaps you can find some in the nearby WALRUS KINGDOM.

Ah, good! Now take this BIG SPOON, use it to get the SPECIAL LENS out of the pudding so you can use it to find the INVISIBLE BOOMERANG SALESMAN to buy a BOOMERANG for the man who stole the ENORMOUS GLASSES from the owner of the RENT DVD, so you can give that to the CAT DEALER and manufacture a FAKE MUSTACHE to disguise the WALRUS PRINCESS so you can kidnap her and wed her to the CAT, gaining the alligance of the man who will SILENCE THE PRETENDER, earning you the KING'S TUSK-TOKENS, which you can use to buy CAFFEINE from the DRINK MACHINE, allowing you to stay awake through OROTH'S BORING GENEALOGY LECTURE, at which point he will bestow upon you the NET to catch the DELICIOUS FISH to feed to the SQUID in exchange for its INK so you can buy a DOORKNOB for the man with WHEAT, then take the wheat to the man with the GREEN KEY!

&nbsp;

Easy, right?

Not sure where this would place on the scale, but half way through this big quest to destroy an artifact that would open a massive gateway into hell on a certain date, we decided to just dump the thing into the ocean.

&nbsp;

Our DM was a little bitter, but he wound up rolling with it, and we had to deal with this whole thing where Ocean levels started dropping and demonic fish-men came out of them. We attempted to solve that by opening a series of gateways from the plane of water (to stabilize the water level), through heaven (because that'd make it holy water right?), and finally into the ocean above the hell-gate.

&nbsp;

Our DM go even more frustrated, and rolled up a demi-god tier enemy called the Gatekeeper for the express purpose of closing all the gates, and telling us to knock it off or die. We killed him last week, and I'm pretty sure our DM is going to ask us to just roll new low-level characters, and just ban us from ever making an all-magic-user party again.

Five years ago I was playing an online SciFi homebrew.

&nbsp;

My character is the head of station security on a space station orbiting some exoplanet.

&nbsp;

I name him Sergeant Frank Drebin.

&nbsp;

Nobody gets the reference.

&nbsp;

Actual rank is lieutenant, so his full title is Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin.

&nbsp;

Rest of the party consists of the captain, the head of engineering, and a scientist

&nbsp;

A suspected terrorist is captured by one of my teams. Time for interrogation. Captain asks me what I'm going to do.

&nbsp;

>Me: I think it's time for some good cop/bad cop.

>Cap: Who's the good cop and who's the bad cop?

>Me: I am.

>Ter: Sure...

>Me: \*Flips the table\* I bet you'd love some cocoa, wouldn't you!?

>Ter: Wtf

>Ter: I... what...

>Me: \*Backhands him\* Admit it! You fucking love cocoa, don't you! You can't get enough of it!

>Me: Perfect, thank you. \*Sits the terrorist's chair back up and hands him the cocoa.\*

>Me: I think we both may have lost our heads for a bit. Let's just relax. \*Starts rubbing his shoulders.\*

>Ter: \*Visibly uncomfortable\* 

>Me: Now, you just enjoy that cocoa - \*Reaches for laser pistol\* - and tell me everything you know about your plot before I get to the count of bang.

>Ter: ???

>Me: Ooh... Ee...

>Ter: I don't know anything!

>Me: Ooh...

>Ter: What are you doing?

>Me: Ah… Ah… \*points the laser pistol at his knee\* 

>Ter: Wtf is happening!?

>Me: Ting... Tang...

>Ter: I don't have anything!

>Me: Walla... Walla...

>Ter: Please! Somebody help me!

>Me: Bing...

>Ter: What is wrong with you!?

>Me: \*Pulls the trigger\*

&nbsp;

Terrorist gives me all the info I need. GM and players are confused as fuck.

&nbsp;

>Me: Okay, everyone, listen up. There's a bomb in Sector 3G. It's set to explode at 0800 hours. Keep your eyes out for Nothing, and remember that Anybody could be armed and dangerous. Don’t be afraid to shoot on sight. And that hot chocolate was delicious.

&nbsp;

Twenty-seven people were killed or injured in the ensuing police action.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 11/12/2014, 19:42

OP here.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the adventures of Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin ended shortly after. The station was torn apart by the twin forces of rampant terrorism and damn fine police work, and then quite literally torn apart by invading aliens. My suggested policy of rigidly enforcing English-only language laws failed spectacularly.

&nbsp;

The group then splintered up soon after.

I recall a group almost ten years ago where "THAT GUY" was a relatively new player to our group and we'd agreed the game was going to be about mid-high fantasy ND heroics - So he shows up with this drunken old man lout of a fighter. Meanwhile were all playing young kind of weeaboo anime hero types.

&nbsp;

We tolerated him and how often he'd talk about how drunk, smelly. and generally obnoxious his character was. He would use metagame knowledge to make fun of our characters in character, laughing at us when we'd get knocked out, calling us cowards when we failed our fear checks, and the DM would take pity on us and just kind of give us "let it slide" looks and let us take rerolls.

&nbsp;

We'd bitch about it between sessions and we sort of grew to hate the guy as a player: His character would go onto long diatribes about dungeons and gold and how useless we were and we'd get into hour long arguments where the OM would constantly have to remind us all to "keep it IC " Anyway this campaign goes on for at least a year, and the storyline is kind of climaxing and a OMNPC gets kidnapped, so after another argument session we get convinced by THAT GUY" to take a suicide mission and storm a castle, and he s basically yelling at us IRL we have to do it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 09/01/2009, 07:03

So when we agree, he leaves the room with the DM for a few minutes. and we assume this s all some metaplot how his going to fuck us over and steal our shit. They come back in as if nothing had happened. Session continues but we're all on guard. assuming something is up. We storm the castle or whatever, and have a lot of fun, not really noticing that this guy has stopped being so obnoxious. He hasn't once mentioned how his character reeks of whiskey or onions or whatever, though he wastes a good five minutes explaining how his character shaved his beard. Whatever. we just assume the DM talked to him about how it was annoying us. Epic battles ensue and Fast forward to face off with the BBEG. some Lich thing and the fight isnt going so well.

&nbsp;

We're getting spanked. our Cleric is down. and Mr. Fighter has a haste and out of nowhere he goes. "I rush to Cedric (the Cleric) and slap him 'GET UP YOU COWARD'." At this point I groan but the DM is like "Cedric, you're back up with XX HP." Then Mr. "Fighter" goes "I turn to the Lich and I smite him." And suddenly it clicked for all of us.

&nbsp;

Fucker had been playing a Paladin the entire time. His insults were his lay-on-hands and calling us out as cowards were his Anti-fear aura. He wasn't That Guy." 'we were "that guy" and we'd just been absolutely out roleplayed for almost a year.

I did something similar. My Necro-Nano-Nuke.

&nbsp;

This was back in 3.5, and required a small amount of DM collaboration. 

&nbsp;

Question 1: Are fleas living creatures?

>Yes. I know they don't have stat-blocks, as such. The DM ruled that they have 1/4 of a hit point each and no attacks, a 10 foot move dependent on a skill check (acrobatics, huge natural bonus) and a diminutive size modifier.

Question 2: is an exoskeleton a 'skeletal structure'?

>Yes. Otherwise you wouldn't have Zombie Thri-Kreen and Zombie-spiders as canon enemies.

Necromancer walks into a stable. Casts Death's Call modified with the Fell Animate metamagic feat. Ever flea in the stable just died (1 HP of damage) and arose as a zombie under his control. But they have no attacks. But becoming a zombie grants them a SLAM attack. for zero damage (massive strength penalty from the FINE size category). No bid deal. The Deadly Chill feat from Libris Mortis added an extra 1d6 cold damage to the zero damage from the slam attack.

&nbsp;

And because fleas are so small they're virtually invisible, nobody ever saw them coming. My necromancer never cast a spell in combat. Ever. He'd simply gesture mysteriously, and frostbite would form on his enemies. Hundreds of undead fleas would cling to the inside of his cloak and leap out at his command. Especially fun when we infiltrated a noble's castle. We knew he was planning to betray us, so I just spread around as many zom-fleas as I could. When he gave the order for his guards to ambush us, they all mysteriously died, leaving him alone to face the party. I would also use them as grenades. Have a dozen cling to the side of a flask of Alchemist Fire. Throw the flask, they all take fire damage, and the Destruction Retribution feat makes them explode in a 10-foot radius Negative energy blast. 

&nbsp;

Ahh, good times. Used to drive the other players NUTS since none of them knew what exactly I was doing. Or why my cloak detected as Undead, or how I did what I did. I miss 3.5.

I got cursed in a game of pathfinder that I'm playing with friends, at level 3. Playing a low Int character already I was reduced to 1 int. The DM has decided that I can no longer control my character, and is "Playing" him for me. I asked if at this point he could just be considered dead, and let me reroll, to which he said no as he can still be fix'd. That was 2 sessions ago. Ever since then I've just sat there doing nothing, unable to play at all, while the Dm has my character act utterly different from what they were Lawful Neutral to just straight Chaotic Stupid. At what point do I just say fuck it and find another game?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/15/2017, 19:38

Instead of asking your DM. Tell him you want to play a new character. If he says no. Just leave.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OP**, 08/15/2017, 19:49

I've tried, but he does the same "There could be someone who could cure him in the next town over" Bullshit. Even the other three have been trying their asses off to find one since I was the only real frontline of the group. But apparently it's a "Incredibly powerful curse that can only be lifted by a unknown means"

&nbsp;

And I'll probably leave this session if I'm not allowed to reroll or cured. Fuck sitting around for 6 hours twiddling my thumbs while the Dm laughs his ass off after having my character give an autism screech and attack a random guard out of no where for "Comic relief"

My character started with 8 int, and I got cursed for -7 int from an Orc Shaman that attacked us on the road, he also cursed the Rogue we had with us for -6 dex, but that was lifted after a session due to him finding a one time use magical stone. Which they used without informing the group they had found it

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OP**, 08/15/2017, 20:19

I texted some of the other players and I think I'm going to find a new group, apparently he does this all the time, as they played with him before, he hates anyone who plays a martial class and tries to either kill them off or get them out of the game, for the reason "In a world of magic no one would use swords, and all the strong people are worthless, since all the smart intellectual people would have power." So fuck that shit. Seems last time he one shot the guy playing the defender ten times and tried to get him to make a wizard each time. And "accidentally" had the group fight a high level monster early on just to kill the front-liners.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OP**, 08/15/2017, 20:48

Okay I got something.

From what my mates telling me, three games ago they had another guy like me that made the mistake of playing a martial class in the fella's quite literal 'Magical Realm"

&nbsp;

Dude played a average human fighter Name "Earl"

So he got put in the same position I'm in now, where the DM was just doing shit to get him to reroll mage. But rather then just planning to Leave he decided to just fuck with the guy.

Everything he died he'd remake a Human fighter named Earl, Son of Earl, and give him exactly the same stats and everything.

&nbsp;

The guy I'm texting helped Earl a little, as when the Dm pulled his "-x int" brings you to 1 int only shit the other guy would accidentally cast a fireball in combat that would fuck Earls ass sideways. (Dm homebrewed fireballs dmg to 3d8 up from 1d6 per caster level)

&nbsp;

So he had a fall back anytime he get cursed. or just randomly mind-controlled. Sadly the guy won't do for me as he's scared the Dm will blackmail him with personal shit again (At this point I think that's how the keeps the other three there.)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OP**, 08/15/2017, 20:49

But it progressed to the point where Earl would die anywhere up to 10-12 times a session, and would just write down a copy and hand it to the dm to join in again soon as the group made camp (Dm allows anyone who dies to instantly rejoin the group in the form a a random adventures that just so happens to walk by.) So thankfully Earl was able to always reappear soon as combat ended as the group would always camp for that exact reason.

&nbsp;

So this progressed to a point where the Dm just kicked him out, Earl's last session involved him showing up with a locked briefcase, that he refused to tell anyone what was in. So things went normal, Earl dies, Earl is cursed, and dies to fireballs, Earl dies, Cave falls, Earl dies, Earl gets one shot, Earl dies, Earl dies. And Earl just kept handing him new character sheets with the exact same shit "Earl, Son of Earl". So when the Dm finally had enough of it and his autist showed he screamed at the guy "How long as you going to keep handing me this stupid fucking fighter you fucking retard." Apparently the guy just stood up, slammed the brief case on the table, and opened it to show he had went a photo-copied close to one thousand pages of "Earl, Son of Earl." Which led to a long stare-down before the Dm screamed the guy out of his house, and trashed the poor man's briefcase and pages, the session ended there because apparently the sight made the dm just lose his absolute shit and be unable to calm down.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/15/2017, 20:51

Okay. You have your next session. Ask a fellow player to fireball your character accidentally, then show him your next character.

&nbsp;

Earl, son Earl, son of Earl.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**OP**, 08/15/2017, 20:54

Dude he might fucking knife me, he doesn't seem like the stable type if he sent the last 5 years just pulling this shit. That and the legit black-milling a guy to get him to stop killing the martial characters he curses.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/15/2017, 21:02

if he knifes you just reroll as Earl son of Earl

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/15/2017, 21:42

Spin Attack is the Battlemaster's Sweeping Attack, technically, unless you have something in mind.

And with the magic stuff, it's mostly things that he was given, himself, rather than actual spellcasting.

Our wizard is a bit of a... lunatic to say the least?

&nbsp;

He likes making planes. Planes. Plural.

&nbsp;

His most recent creation was the "Plane of Infinite Fists and Punching", which was made involving a lot of absinthe and level 20 monks. Basically, any sort of entrance or access to this place has fists constantly coming in and out, and just being in there is like receiving billions of punches in a second. Not a fun place to be in.

&nbsp;

Want to know how he killed the BBEG of the first part of our campaign?

Gate to the Plane of Infinite Fists and Punching. Now, before you think he shoved them in or made it just up in his face so he gets punched a lot, no.

He didn't do that.

&nbsp;

You see, we used some third party feat book, and one let you craft gates into items. Any item. Any.

Want to know what our genius wizard does?

He disguises himself as the BBEG's personal tailor and gives him a pair of briefs. Made from the Gate of Infinite Fists and Punching. They activate on a command word. Want to know what that command word is?

"Splendid!"

&nbsp;

Which the wizard described them as once the BBEG put them on.

&nbsp;

He was infinitely punched in the dick and ass by level 20 monks until he died.

&nbsp;

Fucking wizards, man.

This thread reminds me of one I saw a while back. Mainly just brainstorming material for making the players sad. Well, the DM in the campaign I'm in apparently also saw that thread, because something similar to one of the ideas that got thrown around ended up as a quick, one shot encounter that we happened across while traveling between towns.

&nbsp;

We were approaching a frontier town and ran across a pair of statues by the road. The quality and expressions made it obvious that they were people who had been petrified. A group of similarly equipped people a short distance away confirmed that their party had been attacked by a medusa and they had lost two of their number before they fought it off. We tracked the medusa to its lair, an old ruined temple.

&nbsp;

We found what had obviously been its home, but no medusa. We also didn't find the collection of people-tumed-statues that we thought we would, which meshed with what the residents of the nearby town later told us. They had never even heard of there being a medusa in those ruins, and had certainly never encountered one. Only the group that we had run into on the road had.

&nbsp;

What we did find was a large collection of letters. Apparently the medusa had started writing letters to a man in the nearby town. At first pretending to be a girl who had spurned him, then after a while as they grew closer she admitted who (and even later what) she really was. They eventually agreed to meet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/14/2012, 03:11

We also found a note, addressed to whoever might find and read it, explaining what had happened. The man had arrived at the ruins at the same time another group was exploring the ruins, investigating rumors of a monster hiding out there. And while the group nosing around in the ruins didn't find her, he did. He startled her, saw her, and tumed to stone. The note went on to say that she was leaving the ruins to find some way to cure him.

&nbsp;

There was one more note after that one. At that point the DM handed each of us a piece of paper, which read:

&nbsp;

"I'm such a fool. Of course a lone woman traveling the High Road would look like an appetizing target. I got two of them, but I took a bad hit. Even with the supplies in my pack I dont know if I would make it, and I lost it in the fight. Without it I wont last the night.

&nbsp;

At least I'm not alone anymore.

&nbsp;

I'm such a fool."

&nbsp;

After a short while longer exploring the ruins, we found a solitary statue of a man, looking startled. The statue had been decorated with wreathes and lowers, and curled up at the statue's feet was a dead medusa.

&nbsp;

We went back and found the group from the road. They asked us if we had found the monster. We replied that we had, and proceeded to kill the lot of them.

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 05:23

A warning: even with a small party of three, Combat in pokemon can get a little sluggish. And its a HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS to DM (the Game I ran barely got past the mt. Moon boss fight with a Rotom animating a Backloader before I gave up trying to manage the campaign)

&nbsp;

ALRIGHT CHILDREN LET ME TELL YOU THE TALE OF VINCENT, THE VENDING MACHINE.

&nbsp;

This was in a Godlike campaign, and if anyone knows that system you know you're in for some shit. After I ended our last godlike game by erasing the villain from causality (by stabbing him in the face) and destroying spain, the DM wrote up a post-apocalyptic game in a setting RULED by robots, telling us we had to build mechanical characters. She then informed us that the campaign would be "literally Megaman".

&nbsp;

And so our party was formed of the Brave Little Toaster, Flipsy the wind-up dog that does backflips (and has Wi-Fi), Mr. Zurkon wielding a death-ray, and my creation, Vincent the Vending Machine.

&nbsp;

Opposing us, on the Boss Selection Screen I had the privelage to draw, were Kindling Man, Dance Woman, Wall Man, Mind-Bullets Man, Phase Woman, Clockwork Man, Boat Man, and Metal Werewolf Man.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 05:33

Vincent himself had an ABRITRARILY HIGH Body stat, in exchange for being laughable in every other stat (up to and including a 0 Perception, making him Blind and Deaf), but granting him immense physical strength and a 3-digit HP total at level 1. Also maximum ranks in the "Sumo Wrestling" skill. His talent was "Vend", and here's how it worked: I would declare what I WANTED, and rolled a Vend check. How well I did on the check was how USEFUL the resulting item was for what I wanted it for. Critical Failures were a hell of a drug. (At one point I attempted to Vend something to "live through falling into this pit of magma". The resulting crit-fail caused me to vend a box of puppies, to make it that much sadder when I hit the magma.) We discussed which of our foes we would attack first and it was decided that we would assault the lumber mill stronghold of KINDLING MAN, who had the power to be REALLY FLAMMABLE.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 05:43

Throughout our battles with Kindling Man's forces I consistently kept vending gratuitous amounts of Paper Snakes (Want to vend a distraction? hundreds of paper snakes burst forth from your vending slot. Want to vend something to attack the enemy? hilariously low roll, hundreds of harmless paper snakes.) And so eventually resorted to just violently hurling my own bulk at foes. Conveniently, I appeared to be impervious to the myriad buzzsaw traps in the stage, and simply walked in front of the party while Flipsy guided me. Eventually we reached the BOSS-DOOR, and upon entering we were greeted by the mighty KINDLING MAN, who began monologuing. I attempt to shut him up, roll low, and hundreds more paper snakes BURST from my slot. The rest of the party engages our foe in battle, and I try one last Vend roll to destroy him before rolling up my robosleeves and joining the fray the old fasioned way. Critical Success. I vend a small black bos with a red button on it. Lacking limbs to press it with, I tip myself over and land on the button.

&nbsp;

The thousands of paper snakes filling the entire stage (including the boss room) burst into flame simultaneously. It was a "light paper snakes on fire" button. Kindling Man ERUPTS into flame and begins screaming, while over the walls of the boss room we can see that the entire LUMBER MILL we were in was... not responding well to the large influx of fire. After waiting several rounds for Kindling Man to die (I eventually tackled him because he just kept running around, screaming), we acquired his power and voted on who to give it to. For heroically burning down the entire stage, 'twas decided that Vincent should recieve it. See how it worked was that upon defeating a Robot Master, one of us got a new psuedo-talent with limited ammo (that recharged every stage). And so I got a 3-shot ability to make targets for more flammable than normal. Thus began my ascension.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 05:52

Our recurring "mook" was a powerful, advanced combat robot FAR moreso than us (we were all highly outdated, unearthed in a digsite by the local robot spider villagers hoping us to be the chosen ones to overthrow the evil Doctor Warbington), and had on average about 90 HP, a defensive forcefield, and were capable of dealing 60 damage on a lucky shot of their dual plasma cannons. Flipsy had 10 HP, Mr Zurkon had 70, and I had 720. Mr Zurkon and I worked out a fabulous one-two-punch to defeat them in which he would knock out their shield with a single shot and I would ram them like a goddmaned freight train. And Flipsy used her advanced Wi-Fi network to upload maps of the area and camera footage to me so I could stumble around with something resembling direction.

&nbsp;

Anyway, Lets' see, who did we fight next......That's right, BOAT MAN, who had the power to COMMAND A LEGION OF THE UNDEAD. ...Also he was a 400 meter long airship. Anyway. Using a large trampoline i had vended, and a small hot-air-balloon built by the robot spider villagers, we boarded Boat Man and got on his deck, where we did battle with a tremendous horde of a 100 skeletons. As the battle raged Flipsy hacked into Boat Man's security systems and downloaded a map, uploading it to the party. We promptly discovered the location of the Reactor Room, and that Boat Man was powered by a LARGE, LAAAARGE nuclear reactor. I wordlessly charged to the nearest door below deck, and as they interpreted my goals the party exchanged worried looks and Mr. Zurkon broke the silence with a quiet "I think we should go".

&nbsp;

As the party searched desperately for Lifeboats while battling skeletons, I charged through the flimsy constructs of bone and found Boat Man's reactor. Using my LIMITLESS KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE (and the conenction to the ship's cameras Flipsy gave me so I could see, I used the three shots of Kindling Man's Power to make things outrageously flammable. I USED THESE SHOTS...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:01

on a nearby bucket (and mop) of clear liquid (which I later learned to be fleaning fluid), the Reactor's primary control rod, and the Nuclear Reaction itself. I then turned to the DM and said "I vend fire."

I vended a zippo lighter. Which, failing to activate with my small stumpy vending machine legs, I simply tipped over and crushed in an attempt to create a spark. As the party flew away on their stolen lifeboat, they turned and witnessed Boat Man briefly become a small star. As the nuclear reaction caught fire, the control rod overheated and caught fire, and the explosion knocked the bucker over, sending flaming mop-fluid all throughout the reactor room into all the wiring and such. What happened next was a moment of absolute beauty.

&nbsp;

The resulting supernova failed to actually KILL Boat Man, though it did completely annihilate his engines and he began plumetting to the ground. Simultaneously, I used my last remaining Fate Points (I can't remember the Godlike system's name for them) to boost my Body and HP as HIGH AS I POSSIBLY COULD, in an attempt to survive point-blank nuclear annihilation. The DM then rolls a few dice to see WHERE the screaming ball of Nuclear fire that was Boat Man lands... and promptly buries her face in her hands and informs us that it plummets to earth and... lands on Mind-Bullets Man's stage, obliterating it in an atomic holocaust. She then asks ME to roll luck to see where I land, as I had successfully lived through the three thousand damage I took with 5 HP remaining. I then rolled a Critical Success.

&nbsp;

Having lived through the destruction of his fortress, Mind-Bullets Man steps outside his Boss Chamber to examine the commotion, and is promptly crushed to death by an irradiated vending machine moving at terminal velocity,

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:14

The ability to summon the dead was claimed by Mr Zurkon, while the Mind-Bullets were claimed by the Brave Little Toaster, and we sallied forth. I used my hoarded EXP to buy a third die on all further Vend attempts (and, horrified, we speculate on what would happen if I rolled THREE 10s, as 2 10s was near deus ex machina levels of Get Fucked) Phase Woman, our next target, proved to have a stage consisting of "y'know that hallway in Heatman's stage with the lava floor and the only safety is disappearing blocks? Eight of that hallway." Course this was after the guardian of her stage, a gigantic nuclear-powered bee that shot missiles, and I had to spend a shot of my kindling power to kill. Anyway. This was the dungeon that involved a near TPK as we fell into the lava, because Disappearing Blocks are assholes. Flipsy saved us by hacking into the main control network of the blocks and taking them for herself, allowing us to materialize them wherever we felt like. Of course we came to the OBVIOUS conclusion, and used them to create a giant, teleporting cube-mecha, with Vincent forming the head, and Zurkon and the Toaster as the respective hands. Apparently Phase woman decided "fuck that" and so her Boss Chamber was an elevator to the surface, where she was waiting in a humongous mecha to do battle with us. I use my two remaining kindling shots during the resulting mecha fight... one on Phase Woman herself... and one on her robot's codpiece. The Brave Little Toaster and I then enact out finishing move. He used his Bravery talent to its fullest, and rolled a might roll of his Toasting skill. My cube-mecha's body no wielding a glorious, red-hot hand of justice, I told the toaster to grit his teeth, and punched the enemy robot in the nuts as hard as I could.

&nbsp;

Red-hot Toasting science impacted the bekindled crotch and the mecha's entire pelvis erupted into fire.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:21

I spent a newly acquired fate point to continue this maneuver, and used my giant cube bogy to GRAPPLE the mecha. Hoisting it above my head with my glorious cheating strength (thanks Flipsy, thanks disappearing block mecha), and hold in it such a way that with a final act of defiance, I am able to Suplex Phase Woman's robotic guardian onto Phase Woman herself. Crotch-first.

&nbsp;

The burning crotch ignites the kindling set on phase woman herself, and she is simultaneously crushed and burned to death, while the strength of my suplex sends her mecha THROUGH the ground, destroying the elevator shafter down to the magma caverns and destroying what little structure remained down there. And that's how the Brave Little Toaster got the power to phase through walls and I burned down the first four stages of the campaign. Don't worry, that trend continues.

&nbsp;

Our next target: Wall Man. His stage was the factory responsible for all the asshole robot minions we had to fight. Highlights included vending crude oil all over the assembly line, Flipsy hacking an attack helicopter and playing Ride of the Valkyries over the factory speakers, and the Brave Little Toaster successfully Dimplomacying HAL 9000. And then Wall Man himself arrived. By which I mean WE arrived, because he was, well, a Wall.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:31

I dont even know what half of these reaction images MEAN anymore

&nbsp;

Wall Man was the far-wall of the factory's main ware-house, and COVERED WITH GUNS. Given that we had destroyed basically the entire Factory by this point out of spite, we just kind of tipped him over and left. Flipsy scored us a hijacked airship and we stole the factory's secret prototype, some kinda robot that shot lemons I dont remember. However, tipped-over was RIGHT WHERE WALL MAN WANTED TO BE, and now his guns were pointed up at us! Furthermore, he revealed his secret technique; he had rockets on the other side, and used them to produce lift, flying towards us. Unprepared for an enemy with such bulk and firepower (and invincibility; his power was kind of being immune to damage), all seemed lost. But fret not, said the Toaster, for he had concocted a plan to utilize ALL of the party's strengths. By which I mean Mine and Flipsy's because Zurkon spent most sessions wondering what the actual FUCK was going on. Flipsy used the lemon-bot as a sacrificial lamb, having it dive in the way of one of Wall Man's missiles, and ejecting Vincent and the Toaster from the helicopter. the Toaster hold me to brace myself. And so, did I vend. And so, did I fend with the expressed desire to BREAK SHIT. And so, 4 sessions after acquiring my 3rd vending die, did I roll my 3 tens.

&nbsp;

What came out of Vincent's vending slot was a Lucha Libre mask. One that somehow attached itself to his frame mid-fall. The DM put on heavy metal mariachi music, and told me that I could FEEL power coursing through me, and a cape billowed forth from the base of the mask. Our fall reached its climax, and a split second before we reached our foe... the Toaster activated Phase Woman's power, and phased Vincent inside Wall Man's body.

&nbsp;

And lo, did I BREAK SHIT. using the masks's phenomenal wrestling power, I wrestled Wall Man from the inside out, as his invulnerability only applied to his outside.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:36

SO thoroughly did I wreck his shit that I folded Wall Man into an enormous, burning Paper Crane, which, when I was done, I Chest-Bursted out of. Angling the explosion of the mask's power as best I could as its final swan song, I attempted to ride the explosion back to the safety of the helicopter, while the Crane-shaped Wall Man was propelled in the opposite direction, crashing into one of the post-apocalyptic world's last human settlements and destroying it utterly. Airborned, I attempted another Vending check to do nothing more than look cool. And I proceeded to roll three 9's.

&nbsp;

The DM announced that I proceeded to vend a cluster of dozens of Land Mines, armed, midair. As they fell from my slot, I then Vending seven Tigers, each of whom lept to a nearby land mine, detonating it midair and leaping from the explosion to the next airborne land mine. As I was framed by seven tigers using airborne land mines and stepping stones in the sky, the explosions increased my speed and carried me to the waiting helicopter on literal wings of flame, as my billowing cape burned away.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:45

Satisfied at our efforts, and Vincent requesting Wall Man's invulnerability power for himself. We took a break back at the Spider Village to rest. WHICH WAS ATTACKED BY DANCE WOMAN THE FIEND. Much property damage and some vended Dubstep later, only two robot masters (and stages for me to maliciously destroy) remained.

&nbsp;

Our chosen foe was Clockwork Man; we were informed that his stage was a tremendous clock tower, that was required to re-charge his antiquated technology (apparently he could just pay somebody to wind him up. Nope. Had to be this tower.) Now, I've played castlevania. More to the point, the DM's played castlevania. You could not pay me to climb this fucking clock tower. So, first, I vended a Trampoline to attempt to propel myself to to top floor. This failed. So I threw a brick through the window, out of petty spite. At our conundrum, Mr Zurkon had the first good idea he'd had all campaign, and suggested we simply cover the base of the tower with C4. And so we did. I stepped inside long enough to fire all three shots of kindling man's power up into the bowels of the clock tower, and then ran as the others coated the tower's foundation in heavy explosives. 

&nbsp;

One detonation and one ruined stage later, we collectively high fived at another trivialized Robot Master. Then Clockwork Man walked up behind us.

&nbsp;

He had, in his hands, a paper bag full of groceries, and a Starbucks cup. Clockwork Man was 15 minutes late to his own boss fight with Starbucks. And there he stood, dumbstruck at what we had done to his home.

&nbsp;

So we left. Fuck, he can't hurt as anymore; he'll wind down eventually and won't have a way to turn the key. fuck that guy.

&nbsp;

AND SO WE LEFT TO METAL WEREWOLF MAN'S STAGE, which was a tremendous stone Colosseum. Devoid of enemies. The Boss Door was 10 feet from the stage entrance.

&nbsp;

And so we entered, greeted with an empty arena. And by empty I mean "lined with tesla cannons pointed inwardly, with an elevator shaft in the middle".

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Gary Oak's Merry Men**, 02/18/2014, 06:52

From this elevator rose a ten foot tall lupine form made entirely out of blades and what I can only assume was hatred for all that lived. What ensued was a FAR more climactic battle than we had expected, largely because this was the first Robot Master that could take a goddamn punch, built to be a physical bruiser. We ended up on the ropes, as even Vincent's tremendous HP pool was nothing to the claws of a robot that was also a werewolf with knives for fur.

&nbsp;

And then the Brave Little Toaster used Phase Woman's power on Metal Werewolf Man as he lunged at me, and he phased into my Vending compartment, which we had assumed to be some sort of nth-dimensional space that held anything and everything, and was infinite in scale.

&nbsp;

So uh, good work team. Nice hustle. what's that DM? fuck NO we're not letting him out, we don't CARE if we didn't get his fucking power. He's a goddamned robot werewolf. Flipsy, satisfied at the fact that all of us were alive and LARGELY intact, went over to the aformentioned tesla cannons and hacked into those too. She then overloaded them, and changed their firing angle. The resulting blast of lighting was so powerful that it incinerated Metal Werewolf Man's arena... and she had actually AIMED it a few miles south... at where Clockwork Man was standing. We kind of heard a little "ding!" and she suddenly got clock powers. Yaaaay. And so that's how ALL EIGHT ROBOT MASTERS and ALL EIGHT OF THEIR GODDAMNED STAGES fell by our hands. We started to attack Doctor Warbington's Femur Fortress, but, uh, 10 minutes into that dungeon we armed Vincent with a cannon that shot nuclear reactors and we all kind of agreed there really wasnt anything he could have that would stand in our way and that campaign ended. And then we all played Super Smash Bros.

&nbsp;

THE END.

It wasn't even a trap really, mostly just the result of their own actions. I gave them something which can create gold statues of things they kill. They used this to make a massive amount of gold statues and then melted the gold down and gave massive amounts to every town they came across (nearly all the towns they had come across were impoverished due to the bad state of the continent). They weren't giving away small amounts, they wanted everyone to live like a king so each person got at minimum their own weight in gold. This just lead to massive inflation of gold and broke the already fragile trade system in place putting them back to bartering animals and food for services.

&nbsp;

The character they took the statue maker from warned them of its potential misuse so it's not like I'm being that dm and trying to fuck them out of nowhere, besides I feel they should have had some common sense about it honestly.

&nbsp;

Jumping right in. A little unorthodox, but even experienced GMs can stumble a little getting from character generation to the adventure portion. I can understand wanting to gloss over that. 

&nbsp;

But coming all this way on no more specific information? We're not buying it.

&nbsp;

That's when we put on the breaks. Except he thinks HE's the one putting on the breaks when we don't give the expected response to "blort". He's flipping out because he genuinely regards his baby-talk to be coherent descriptions. We try to calmly explain that "toink" and "blort" aren't going to cut it and he's just getting more and more upset with us. 

&nbsp;

I should point out that he's seen people run RPGs before, he's gamed with us for years, AND he's never been even remotely this obtuse as a player. This came out of nowhere.

**Anonymous**, 04/05/2012, 16:05

My character has a stuffed tarrasque.

&nbsp;

No, not a real one, just a little one that he carries around with him.

&nbsp;

In all other regards, he's a tough mercenary who lacks any sense of a soft side. He takes what he wants whenever he wants it, and respects no one who can't beat him in a fight. I will admit that it's somewhat jarring for such a character to carry around a stuffed animal, but I'm rather prone to allowing my characters to think for themselves, and this guy really likes his tarrasque toy.

&nbsp;

The other players in my group simply considered it an eccentricity of the character and didn't think too much about it, especially because their characters were far weirder and had odder habits and traits. However, my DM started to obsess about the stuffed animal.

&nbsp;

I didn't originally intend to hide the "story" behind the stuffed animal from my DM. but when he first asked me what my characters reason for it was. I got a sense that it wasn't really the mood to explain it. I just dodged the question, fully intending to explain myself later, but my DM's attitude suddenly soured and he demanded to know, saying that characters couldn't have any secrets that the DM didn't know.

&nbsp;

I decided to simply refuse that idea by not telling him the reason why my character had a stuffed animal, and I had enough cheek to still ask for his "permission" for my character to have a stuffed animal. He likely would have refused if he could come up with a reason that wouldn't invalidate everyone else's characters, but without such a reason he gave me his permission.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/2012, 16:07

It wasn't even a really interesting "story." He just received the toy as a child, and no one ever explained that only children play with toys. It was just supposed to be a minor note of my character, a way to show that he didn't care what others thought about him and that he had different ideas of what made a man a man.

&nbsp;

However, my refusal to speak about it made everyone think there was some melodramatic story behind the toy, like it was the last gift from his dying mother or a memento of a slain son. I tried to keep the toy as just something that was listed on his character sheet under "Items," but my DM just couldn't get over the fact that I was keeping a part of my characters story to myself.

&nbsp;

The DM tried to make my character's life difficult, by having villagers ridicule him for carrying around the toy and people treating him like he had the mind of a child. When he realized this didn't bother me and some good roleplaying resulted from it, he decided to change tact by trying to get rid of the toy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/2012, 16:07

Fireballs started to damage our items. Thieves began to regularly visit us in the night. Ethereal Filchers, Raggomoffyns, moths and mold, sunlight and dirt, everything in the world that could either damage, steal or eat my character's toy was thrown at it. Of course, my character would try to protect the tarrasque, often very enthusiastically, until my characters sole defining trait was how much he cared about the toy.

&nbsp;

Finally, it happened. A black dragon's acid breath. Poor reflex saves, and an overwhelming amount of damage. Half of my backpack was destroyed, and the stuffed animal wasn't the hardiest of objects.

&nbsp;

My DM couldn't help but smile. We both understood how a story was created, and my character had a very small window in which he had a chance to explain the toy's story. When one of the other players asked him about it, he would either have to explain it, or it would just be decided that he never had a story to begin with and they toy would be eventually forgotten as just a weird quirk of my character. It was either reveal the story while it was relevant, or throw away the chance forever.

&nbsp;

As much as I didn't want to tell the DM my story, I had to admit that I was trapped. It was just how the story had to go.

&nbsp;

Otherwise, it would be a bad story.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/2012, 16:08

So, after we had killed the black dragon, the opportunity arose. A player asked me why I had cared so much about the toy.

&nbsp;

I asked the group if they ever had any toys when they were children. After a brief moment, they all (except for the drow rogue) said they had.

&nbsp;

I asked them if they really cared about a particular toy, really cared about it, took it with them everywhere.

&nbsp;

Some of them had. Oddly enough, the DM chimed in, saying he remembered also having a stuffed animal he carried around with him everywhere until he was eight. I ignored him, and continued.

&nbsp;

I asked them what happened to that toy. There was a moment of silence as the players thought about it, and I helped them with an answer. "You lost it, right?"

&nbsp;

"You couldn't find it one day, and you looked everywhere for it. You asked your parents if they had seen it, and they said it would turn up. So, you cried a little here and there, but only because you were lonely. You still thought that you would find it eventually."

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/2012, 16:09

&nbsp;

"Every few days you would search around the house, around the yard, thinking up new places to look even though you knew all the places it could be. The days stretched into weeks, into months, until you lost hope, and had to accept that it was gone. You'd never see it again."

&nbsp;

"You didn't realize. You never even imagined. It never crossed your mind that something could convince your parents that you were too old to carry a toy with you everywhere. That's because you can't see it that way. You don't understand this idea that losing that toy will let you better fit in with society. You don't believe that it will help you learn about coping with grief and loss, and will make you more mature."

&nbsp;

"The thing you really can't understand is how your parents can give you something, allow you to grow to love it, to love it more than anything else, and then take it away from you."

&nbsp;

"I watched my parents take mine. They thought I was asleep."

&nbsp;

"I left my home that night, because I couldn't understand. I couldn't understand what kind of person could see someone love something, to genuinely care about it, and to take it away from them."

&nbsp;

My DM sat across from me, but he couldn't look at me.

15 Reasons Why the Folding Boat is the best Magical Item ever created:

&nbsp;

1) Your team always has access to a boat. That's pretty swanky.

2) Your team gets to sleep indoors every night.

3) Your team has a permanent base of operations no matter where they are.

4) You get to tell your friends to "Get on your Pinnace".

5) No cover? No problem! Unfold into Rowboat mode to gain an instant shelter.

6) Those enemies getting to much to handle? Go, Gigantic Boat out of nowhere! Use Body Slam!

7) You get to tell your friends to get the monster OFF your Pinnace.

8) Stuck in a sewer level with those obligatory 5-foot gaps that the Cleric can never cross? Just plop down Rowboat Mode to make a bridge!

9) You can reenact that crazy rowboat scene from Pirates of the Carribean where they walk underwater.

10) Keep some wheels handy and it's a breeze getting all that treasure out!

11) More Pinnace Jokes.

12) As a result of reason 2, you NEVER have to pay for Inns ever again.

13) You're always qualified for the Dread Captain prestige class.

14) When performing Reason 6, you get to make as many boat-based one-liners as you wish ("Holy Ship!" "Ship Ahoy!", Batten down the Hatches!") 

15) All of this, and it only weighs FIVE. POUNDS when folded up and costs less than a +3 weapon.

He even sets out to rescue the kidnapped girl (obvious Stockholm Syndrome) and kill the beast before it could threaten the peaceful villagers. Sadly he was playing in one of those edgy campaigns where the bad guy always wins.

Plot twist: Gaston is the hero of the story.

Let's not forget that Belle is a total Mary Sue.

>Everyone likes Gaston and his 36 CHA except Belle

>Gaston has three blonde bombshells who are more than willing to share, yet he still goes after Belle and Belle alone

>Belle and her father are the fucking only ones who read in their entire village, even though it has a bookstore. If we are to believe this then either she and her father read enough to keep the bookstore running by themselves, or it's a front for an illegal drug ring

>There's this big, dangerous monster that everyone's afraid of but he falls in love with Belle because she's special and pretty and not like all the other girls

This is the kind of stuff you see on a socially awkward tween girl's fanfiction.net account.

> Two bards, a wizard, and a paladin

>Fae are kidnapping humans

>Find out that apparently Faerie Queen's lover was killed by a demon lord, and kidnapping humans somehow harms the demons in an incredibly roundabout way.

>Try to prevent war, since we're more statted for intrigue and diplomancy than anything else.

>Split up, it's me and the wizard heading to hell while the Paladin and other bard go to Faeland. I have to roll a spot check and fail it miserably. GM won't tell me what it was about.

>Try to calm everyone down.

>Over in hell, find out succubi manipulated the demon lord into this, because their queen thinks the fae killed her favorite sex toy. And her second through fifth favorites.

>Wizard had permanencied Protection from Evil on himself

>I don't, have demonbutt all over me while trying to be serious and diplomatic.

>SuccuQueen insists that she be compensated for her loss, or she'll continue to feed the conflict.

>Wizard sarcastically comments that this situation is what bards exist for.

>SuccuQueen takes comment seriously and makes my character "prove his worth"

>Wizard slips me a ring with a comically high perform bonus he had apparently made beforehand.

>Roll for performance and endurance

>19,18

>10 hours of negotiations later, SuccuQueen sends a message to FaeQueen to begin discussing peace.

>Yay

Make it to the meeting, wearing clothing marking that I belong to SuccuQueen now. Other bard and paladin haven't shown up yet, but FaeQueen has. 

>SuccuQueen starts by insisting that she have right to bards and that Succubi have to "inspect" bards for exceptional individuals before Fae can get any from bards.

>FaeQueen refuses immediately, and claims that she should have rights to bards, with similar conditions.

>What the fuck is going on.

>Paladin and other bard show up. Other bard is wearing clothing with the emblem of the Fae royal house.

>mfw wizard slipped him another ring before we split up and that was the spot check

>mfw wizard plotted to give both rulers a good lay just because he thought it would be funny

>mfw other bard's player tells me that he had two nat 20s on his sexytime rolls

>mfw my character's dream in life is to marry a cute human girl and have a happy loving marriage with two kids and a small house.

&nbsp;

Campaign is still going on. Last session ended with the war being called back on, only now it's over which side gets exclusive rights to the D instead of revenge. Final line was Paladin facepalming and mumbling about how he's too chivalrous for this bullshit.

&nbsp;

God damn wizards. No sense of right and wrong at all.

Story time, /tg/.

>3.5 game, four players

>Three players (including myself) have special snowflake backstories about redeeming ourselves from working in an evil empire or being a runaway princess or the last scion of an ancient warrior order

>Plus a druid who's just some guy

>We level up, doing our thing, and everyone always gives elaborate speeches and such, except for the druid

>Every time an NPC makes eye contact with him, he challenges them to a duel

>Every time we encounter anything of interest to the story, he makes a random statement that's, at best, vaguely related to what's going on ("I bet those leaves would be comfortable and easy to wear," "I'm a cool guy, I have a girlfriend")

>He has no goals, no backstory, nothing. He's just some guy with a dire rat

>For ten sessions, I am the only person who gets the joke, everyone else just thinks he's weird. He knew I'd get the joke and asked me not to tell the others until they figured it out on their own

>We're now level 8, everyone has told him a dozen times to get a better animal companion

>Finally, finally, FINALLY, his dire rat gets killed by some random-ass ooze

>He breaks down crying, and everyone gets quiet: in similar circumstances, we'd always allowed the player to make a short speech for RP purposes, everyone thinks he's about to do so

>"Do you remember my animal companion?" he asks, cradling it in his arms. "He was in the top percentage of--"

>Everyone except me screams out "FUCKING HELL" or something to that effect

>He and I burst out laughing

The entire session was nothing except Pokemon references, so we got basically nothing else done for an hour.
