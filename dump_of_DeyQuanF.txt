Let me tell you about necromancy, /tg/. I played a necromancer once, in what I thought was a solo game over IRC.

&nbsp;

I went around to places where the economy was horrible, the rulers were tyrants, and the people were downtrodden.

&nbsp;

There, hidden in cairns and crypts, I taught. I taught the people how to use the dead in their defense--and when defense was not needed, in their fields. I taught spellcraft and surgery. I taught them to think for themselves.

&nbsp;

I overthrew tyrants, I saved civilizations. I left in my wake prosperous, well-fed democracies, populated by the living and the working dead.

&nbsp;

Eventually, I became old. Tired. I knew that lichdom was not for me--benefits aside, I was ready to move on. I had mastered this side of death--yet there was so much more to learn, that required intimate knowledge of the other side.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/20/11, 00:48

As I prepared my final resting place, with a missive spell to go out to all my proteges, I used a simple scrying spell to view the places I had visited, once more.

&nbsp;

What I saw surprised and disgusted me. The living once again worked the fields, instead of the schools and libraries. So-called 'good kings' once more had tyranny over the people. Ignorance and fear ruled these lands again. And bodies were cremated, even the bones, and scattered so that no necromancer could use them, for good or for ill.

&nbsp;

I traced back the lines of fate to find what had caused such disasters, what had destroyed the lands which I had saved.

&nbsp;

Adventurers, So-called saviors, hunting down the most powerful necromancer in the world. The Arch-Lich, they called me. I wasn't even dead! The stories they circulated claimed I had lived a thousand-thousand years, spreading misery and the walking dead in my wake. Misery, most certainly not, and I was scarcely sixty years old, though my mentor had certainly lived a long time, and his mentor before him. I was not even a lich!

Not long after I discovered this, my body failing, one organ at the time, this group of adventurers found me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 07/20/11, 00:49

I lay on my deathbed. They were expecting a fight, some cackling, evil mastermind to kill so that they could have been called heroes. They did not expect an old, bitter man who had seen his life's work destroyed because of paranoia and bigotry.

&nbsp;

I told them what I had done, and why I had done it. I told them of my hopes and dreams, for a world where no living man would have to work, where all could spend time doing what they truely desired--study, advancement, even the simple pleasures of a small farm and family, if they so wished. A world free of petty tyrants, where each man could vote for the ruler of their town or their nation.
In the end, I cried. For my proteges, good men dead at the hands of these heroes. For my plans, dashed against the rocks of hatred. For myself, an old, broken dying man with a wasted life.

&nbsp;

As it turns out, my DM was using me as the BBEG for another campaign he was running... and according to him, I succeeded beautifully.

My DM and group decided to stat an evil campaign, something I didnt really want to take pat in and in hindsight should have not joined at all.

&nbsp;

My character was in a group that contained a barbarian cannibal, a witch that poisoned wells on whims, and a wizard that wanted to take over the world. I was playing a rogue.

&nbsp;

In our partys downtime, which was spent in a city the wizard wanted to take over, we each did our own thing- The barbarian stated an underground arena where he ate the losers, the witch and wizard experimented on slaves, and my character stalked a young girl.

&nbsp;

That's it Just making hide checks and watching a young girl from a distance. Whatever my intents were, I didnt reveal them, and this made everyone feel what I consider unreasonably uncomfoftable.

&nbsp;

The barbarian, who enjoyed describing the different pats of the humans he ate as supple or juicy, was the first to tell me out of character that I was fucked up.

&nbsp;

The rest of the group chimed in, but when I reminded them that no one said anything when the witch injected demon blood into a pregnant slave's belly in an attempt to aftificially create a half-demon (and ended up just poisoning both the mother and the fetus), they grudgingly kept quiet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:01

The DM, as if to try and dissuade me from my chosen course, had the young girl's life be remarkably uneventful. She woke up, had breakfast, and went to the academy where she studied. After classes, she went home, had dinner, studied some more, and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

After six months of in-game time, the barbarian had a small group of cannibalistic gladiators as his underlings, the witch had successfully stated a pan-demon breading project, and the wizard had infiltrated the High Council of the city and had stated secretly administering a highly addictive drug. My character had learned the young girl's name, knew her favorite foods, saw which students she got along with, and even had a pretty good idea of which boys fancied her.

&nbsp;

At first, I had thought that the rest of the group was uncomfoftable with me stalking the young girl because they thought my character was doing it for sexual purposes. Slowly, I realized it was because over the course of the game sessions, they had all stated to care, in their own small ways, about this studious little girl Though their characters did horrible, unspeakable things to people, those people were all nameless strangers that none of them saw as humans. My character, however, was getting to know his intended victim, carefully and diligently, with the rest of the group slowly getting to know her as well.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:02
 
By the time the wizard had full control of the city, his player knew that the little girl wanted to study exotic plants, especially flowers. The academy that he know had complete control over was her favorite place in the world, and her worst fear was if something aver happened to it.

&nbsp;

The witch had minor demons raping slaves in secret chambers within the sewers, with many of their foul progeny spilling out into the streets above. A few of these chambers were dangerously close to the roads the young girl took to get to school, though thankfully for her the monsters only came out during the night.

&nbsp;

The barbarian had been tracked down by a trio of bastards he had spawned many years ago, each of them seeking to kill the father who had abandoned them- After the barbarian had killed and devoured them, in the end the player knew less about his characters own children than he did about the stranger that the partys rogue had decided to stalk.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2012, 19:02

By then, everyone had stated to suspect that I had no ill-intent towards the girl I had done nothing to interact with the girl, nothing even remotely involved with her, besides being a stone's throw away from her as much as possible. The barbarian proposed a theory, in that my character's only intent was to hone his stealth skill during his free time and that l, being unwilling to actually commit to being evil, had chosen a "mildly evil-themed" approach. I didnt refute this theory.

&nbsp;

After that moment, the group seemed to actually take an interest in the young girl From a callous perspective, they were just using her to provide their characters with someone they could be good towards just to create a greater sense of depravity in the evil they committed. From a kinder perspective, the players were good people at heat and just couldn't be evil to the young girl3
The Academy was provided with extra funding, and a set of green houses were built for the excluswe use of the students. The demon blood experiments were now under close supeMsion, with nightly patrols to 
help eradicate the escaped specimens. The barbarian, straightfomard as ever, simply approached the girl, gave her a rare potted plant, and told her that if she ever wanted anything, she could ask him for it 

**!/jexuKnPKY**, 05/28/2012, 19:03

In the following months, she became a soft of mascot for the group. Though all of their methods were evil, they now justified their actions by saying they were for the benefit of this young girl, who they secretly (and not so secretly) doted upom At first, only the barbarian was on speaking terms with the girl, but after the wizard took an official position as a governor of the school and the witch soon followed after him, they all came to know the girl, more than they had Simply through my characters observations.

&nbsp;

Our campaign was slowly, ever so slowly, shifting in alignment as the players began to question their characters methods. As they grew closer to the young girl, it became harder and harder to conceal their experiments and activities. At first, they only stopped the most Ob/lOUS ones, but eventually the die-hard evil group had shifted to a rather neutral, if not patially good, party.

&nbsp;

Our DM, who loved character arcs and unlikely story progression, praised my character for introducing an element into the story that allowed a group of evil people to redeem themselves. As he described the young girl walking home from the greenhouses, the DM took a moment to also say that he suspected that I had always planned to eventually turn the evil campaign into an ordinary one.

&nbsp;

Laughing, I told him I had never had such an intent, and then I told him how my character silently emerged from the shadows, stalked towards the girl, and stabbed her in the neck.

**Unknown author**, unknown time

A statue made out of pure sodium. The group's techpriest went full overthinking mode, thinking (rightly) that there was a trap, and (wrongly) checked the entire room except for the statue itself.

The group's archmillitant then took the statue, and dragged it into the underwater passage that was the only way out of the room - it was glorious.

[Drawing of Death, a skeleton in a black cloak holding a scythe, pointing at the viewer with a menacing expression on his face.]

I posted this late last night, but I'm posting it again for all you morningfags.

&nbsp;

(Story starts below)

&nbsp;

So in my DnD 3.5 game, death is a living entity, right? I gave him divine rank 0 for shits and giggles in case the players ever felt like slaying death and starting on their way to godhood.

&nbsp;

Anyway, as per every Death ever, my death let's people challenge him to a game of their choosing. If they win, they can come back to life with no level loss or anything. Of course, death rarely loses. Not only this, but he can choose to not allow a particular challenge. He often only does this in cases of “lol lets play I win you lose”

&nbsp;

The party consists of a fighter, cleric, binder, and wizard. In an almost total party wipe, everyone but the binder died. Damn nasty frost worm nest that was…I’ve never seen so many 20s.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/23/2009, 15:18

All three naturally challenge Death to a game. The fighter, thinking he’s clever with his Greater Cleave and such, challenges Death to a goblin slaying contest. First one to kill the most 1st level warrior goblins, out of an infinate number, in one minute (ten rounds) wins. Death pumped out a bunch of AOE spells, making good use of quickened spell, and won.

&nbsp;

The cleric challenges Death to a game of pleasing the cleric’s god; Pelor. Whomever performs the most acts appeasing Pelor in 24 hours wins, Pelor himself deciding. The cleric enters into a meditation and communicates with his deity that he only entered this pact to have things done in his favor, therefor anything Death ends up doing should be counted for him as well. He then performs a ritualistic dance to one up this number so it wouldn’t be a tie. Death then goes to slay a bunch of Pelor followers and Pelor is so pissed that, even though the cleric won and was revived, Pelor smites him back into dust. Death laughed and asked if he’d like another game, but the Cleric just said no.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 08/23/2009, 15:19

Finally, the wizard challenges Death to a game of wits. Wow wizard, way to be original. He proposes that they ask each other riddles until someone gets three wrong. Death just made up shitty riddles with no real way to answer them unless you were really lucky or on his same though process and won.

&nbsp;

So I’m laughing my ass off right about now. Suddenly the binder says he wants to challenge death to a game for his companion’s souls. If the binder wins, they are all revived. He loses, death can take him too. Death says sure. So the binder challenges death to a game of planar hide and seek, with death as the hider and the binder as the seeker. Death wins if the binder can’t find him in two weeks. No invisibility/scrying/disguises/etc allowed. The Binder spends the time fighting the frost worms who so violently defeated his allies. Naturally he loses and Death pops up to take him to the afterlife. The binder just smiles and says “Found you.” Death giggled so hard he decided to revive the Binder along with his buddies.

My players complain about the campaign having too much mindless killing when it's only that way because they force it that way.

They want a mystery game. I give them a mystery game. They do the bare minimum amount of searching and just turn to murder the second they think they solved it. Their definition of "solved it" is different than the sort you'd find in any dictionary.

&nbsp;

Posted this before, but...

&nbsp;

>Players want a mystery game

>Run a Clue-style murder mystery, tell everyone to make PCs as such

>One guy is a big beefy bouncer type. He's big, beats people to death with a literal club, and is incapable of doing anything else of note.

>Two roll up a pair of bank robbers. They shoot first, shoot second,and keep shooting until there's no one left to ask questions to.
Fourth rolls up a private investigator, if only because someone had to have investigation skills. Even then he spent most of his points split between martial arts and shooting people.

>They get invited to the isolated manor for on reason or another and either drive up or take a cab.

>They get greeted by a butler, who has a blonde maid(remember this part) take them upstairs to see the master of the house.

>Partway outside the door, they hear a yell and a gunshot.

>Them and the maid rush into the room to find the master dead, and someone jumping out the window. They're gone by the time they run over to look outside.

>The police are called and no one is allowed to leave.

>No footprints or any sign of someone leaving are found, so the culprit MUST still be on the premises.

>The PCs go up to look. And by the I mean the private eye does while everyone else flips over tables and shoves paintings and bookcases aside looking for stuff to loot
No attempt to keep the crime scene as is or not tamper with evidence

>Private eye does his thing

>Gripped in the man's hand is a few strands of blonde hair, you check the gu-

>OF COURSE, the group declares, the killer had blonde hair!

>The decide this is enough to lock down the killer's identity and leave the room.

>They make no further attempt to check the body or find more evidence. Even the guys who loot the place don't find it odd there was no sign of a struggle, or that none of the loot was touched, or that there was no sign of forced entry or anything.

>They quickly make a list of everyone they know who has blonde hair. Considering they've only spoken to two people so far, this is a very short list.

>Wait, the maid had blonde hair. Of course, SHE must be the killer. You know, the one who was with us when we saw the man killed, and is the only person that can't be the killer.

>Nope, she has blonde hair, the killer has blonde hair, case closed.

>Instead of going to the police, they take matters into their own brain damaged hands.

>They find the maid on the second floor, grieving.

>I hope they try to interrogate her or make some attempt to find the truth. Even have her alibi "I was with you when he died you dipshits" all prepared.

the police starts shooting at them. The private eye dies to a gunshot to the head, the car swerves out of control since he was driving, and one of the bank robbers decides to break open one of their molotov bottles to start stabbing the police with it.

>Spilling gasoline all over the inside of the out of control car.

>They all die when it crashes and explodes.

I honestly just completely gave up running anything but murderhobo power fantasies for these idiots

Embellished slightly to make it seem more dramatic/silly I'll admit.

&nbsp;

Everything in the story did actually happen though. That was probably the most drastic example I've had happen still.

&nbsp;

Every mystery game ends something like they though.

>Party has mystery because they want to have a less murder-frenzy game

>They do the bare minimum investigating to find a single clue

>They decide that single clue is the entire lynchpin of their investigation, jump to the first conclusion they come to based on that one clue.

>They run with that one conclusion and just start murdering everything involved.

>Get angry when they start fighting back, blame me for turning it into a murder frenzy game.

&nbsp;

I just run murder frenzy games for them. They still whine, but they're all fine just getting railroaded from one murderfest to the next. One of them decided to run their own game once because he wanted to show me "How you run a mystery right."

&nbsp;

It was the sort of baby's first theft mystery you'd find in an Encyclopedia Brown book, and we "solved" it in about 10 minutes

I've played a campaign where we got to the final battle, and the primary villain destroyed the Fighter's magic sword. The Fighter went:

&nbsp;

> "Well, I guess I can't do anything to hurt him now. I kill myself."

&nbsp;

Then the Rogue went "Shit, then I kill myself too, since we can't win the fight." The Wizard said "Half of the party is dead, I guess I kill myself." That left me, the Cleric. Deciding to show solidarity, I said "I'm the only guy left? I kill myself." 

&nbsp;

I like to think that after this spontaneous outbreak of suicide, the villain just sat in a bar and wondered what the fuck this was all about.

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:36

I have a couple of stories floating around /tg/ at this point, most about D&D with my amazing DM, but what people don't know about him is just how dark he can get.

&nbsp;

Take our Call of Cthulhu campaign.

&nbsp;

See, we got a little bit uppity and may have over stepped our bounds, which put the DM, or GM in this case, into maximum passive-aggressive mode. In 3 sessions, a group of 4 of players lost no less than two dozen characters. And they went out brutally.

&nbsp;

Some caught fire, some lost their minds and went rambling into the night, and more than a couple shot themselves after taking out an ally or semi-important NPC. Needless to say, we had lost a lot of hope for playing a full campaign with a single character.

&nbsp;

And then I created Bonzy, the sad clown.

&nbsp;

Bonzy was my way of trying to apologize to the GM, a way to appease him if you will. After all, what better way to show heartbreak than with a symbol of joy and fun shattered into a broken and unloved shell?

&nbsp;

Bonzy dressed simply. He wore very little makeup, a small red nose, had dark hair, and his clown uniform was covered with an old, worn trench-coat that was not as bad-ass as it implied. He had a slight drinking problem, but managed to maintain sobriety without withdrawal, and never seemed to crack a smile.

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:38

He met the other players by chance, having missed his bus and decided to bum it in the town for a few days because hell, it's not like he really had anywhere to be after all. The first character to find me thought I was a traveling clown, and tried to strike up a chat about his chosen career.

&nbsp;

“Hey, Bonzy, know any good jokes?”

“... Why did little Suzy fall of the swings?”

“I don't know, why?”

“Because little Suzy lost her arms to cancer years ago.”

Bonzy sighed, slowly reached up, and honked his nose.

&nbsp;

The table was dead quiet, save for the player I just spoke to. He wore a priceless expression of “sweet god you're serious” and quietly giggled.

&nbsp;

“Do, uh, you know any others?”

“Knock knock.”

“Who's there?”

“Not Suzy.”

Honk

&nbsp;

The game proceeded rather organically from there, with the occasional interjection from Bonzy on why the town was fucked up and we should leave. When they encountered a librarian who just so 'happened' to be the local cult leader, Bonzy was the first to know. After all, who else would know when someone was faking anything?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:39

The trap we set was simple, but if anyone here has played Call of Cthulhu, then you know simple doesn't mean jack. We entered the library, two of us moving to the roof, the third sneaking behind the building. Leading the charge? The only one who didn't care what happened; Bonzy. The sad clown ever so quietly knocked on the door, watching the librarian fish for his keys as rain gently drizzled in the night outside the windows. Bonzy entered, took off his coat, and draped it over his arm with only a few words of greetings.

&nbsp;

As we talked, our third guy suddenly found himself at the business end of a shotgun, and as if he was a machine, pulled out another character sheet and started generating a new character. The other two were just as unlucky, knocked down and grappled by other cultists who were on the stairwell. Everyone was already pulling out sheets, muttering how they made a mistake and were going to do better next time.

&nbsp;

But they forgot Bonzy.

After all, nobody cares about Bonzy.

&nbsp;

The librarian, still unaware of the ruse, pretends to act nice, talking about the books and how he hopes that the fire was going to be enough to dry off. And then, Bonzy hearing the clattering, decides to act. The librarian also decides to ask the obvious question of Bonzy.

&nbsp;

“So, since you're a clown, I'm sure you know plenty of jokes. Got any about books?”

“Sure. What did the one book say to the other?”

“What?”

“I was just checking to see if we were on the same page.”

HONK

BLAM

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times**, 02/09/2015, 22:40

Bonzy fired the revolver he was hiding under his coat, spreading the librarians brains over the bookshelves directly behind him. This of course alerted the cultists to the sad clown below, and the one behind the building decided to investigate, leaving the tied up player beaten, but alive.

&nbsp;

The cultist rounds the corner, pulling out his gun and trying to spot something in the library. He never saw Bonzy behind him with the law book.

&nbsp;

Ten hits over the head later, Bonzy wipes the blood off his face and examines his work.

“Guess I threw the book at you.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The other three cultists on the room, send two of their own to investigate, which were promptly disposed of by the sad clown lurking in the shadows with the gun and a collected works of Shakesphere.

“Not to be, I guess.”

HONK

&nbsp;

After freeing his allies and finding a map of the area, Bonzy turned to his group, and stated flatly

“I'll be in the car. Reading in the dark is bad for your eyes.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The campaign continued without much happening for awhile, losing only one member in the span of a month of game time, which we thought spoke highly of our redeemed status, but I wouldn't stop yet. I wanted to ensure our GM wasn't going to kill us in the middle of the night. Bonzy remained just as sad, and it served him well when they met the second group of cultists.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:06

The location was an abandoned funeral home. Apparently, the cult was of an eldritch god who was most powerful with the dead. No big surprise, seeing as everyone up to this point had connections with some dead family member from years ago. We pull the car around the back, two sneak in the vent, and two (Bonzy) sneak in the back door. We knock out two guards and tie them up with a stretchy rubber chicken, then make our way deeper into the building. First room we find with a cult? The morgue.

&nbsp;

The cultist tosses a knife, landing in Bonzy's ally shoulder. Bonzy pulls out a gun and fires off two into the cultists chest, killing him and blowing their cover. Bonzy wastes no times in preparing his next plan. He pulls out the knife and stifles the wound (Having been a performer, he had dealt with knife wounds before), and told him to wait by the door with a gun while Bonzy waddled into the shadows to meet up with the rest of the group. He spotted a cultist in the hall, but managed to hide long enough to sneak behind him as the cultist passed.

&nbsp;

Bonzy raised the knife to his throat, and quietly slit it before he could alert the others.

&nbsp;

“Guess that was a close shave.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The other upstairs cleared the rest out, and helped Bonzy lug the wounded character back to the car, but not before they saw another group of cultists preparing for something nasty in the wings of the funeral home, so Bonzy opts to investigate, with a friend of course. Bonzy was sad, not stupid.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:08

Investigating paid off, and Bonzy and the friend uncover the cultists attempting a ritual to summon their dead god. The character says with a few minutes, he can put a bomb together, but it looks like it'll take more time. So, Bonzy volunteers.

&nbsp;

Imagine the cultists surprise when this rather depressed looking clown waddles out from the shadows, holding a little flower and a deck of cards. It was time for the routine.

&nbsp;

“What did the dead god say to the humorless cultists?”

“...”

“Is it dead in here or what?”

HONK

&nbsp;

“Who are you, clown?”

“Please, call me Bonzy. Clown was my father.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The cultists mutter a hushed debate about how to kill Bonzy, who was taking this time to turn the flower into a napkin, and then pulling it out of his sleeve. One cultist got closer, and Bonzy offered him a hand of cards.

&nbsp;

“Pick a card, any card.”

The cultist reached for a card-

“Not that one.”

The cultist stopped, and reached for another-

“Not that one either!”

Finally, the cultist grabs his card, studies it, and offers it to Bonzy.

“Why are you giving it back?”

“Because you're going to make it disappear.”

“And waste a perfectly good playing card?”

HONK

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times part deux**, 02/09/2015, 23:09

The cultists finally run out of humor and pull out knives to sacrifice the sad clown before them to their dead god. Lucky Bonzy, the friend finishes the bomb just in time, which he tosses to Bonzy. The clown lifts it up as the timer counts down. The cultists back up, waiting for a pun from the strange clown.

&nbsp;

“No clever words this time?”

“... Not really.”

“Are you out of jokes?”

“No, I just want to go out with a bang.”

HONK

&nbsp;

After we high tailed it out of there, the group managed to save the player with the knife wound, and Bonzy survived with only minor injuries and a scar on his upper arm from a brazing bullet. Dozens of puns, sad clown routines, and close shaves later, we decoded the last clue from the books, and we had it. The final showdown spot where everything must come to an end. And I think somewhere, we all knew Bonzy was tired of being sad all the time.

&nbsp;

Bonzy was going to finally have his peace.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:38

A graveyard, hundreds of years old, and plenty creepy, was full of cultists that seemed armed to the teeth with daggers and strange magic. We had found a way to hoard the weapons from the police station, and entered the fray like a 4 man army right out of the pulp fiction books. We left nothing in our wake, and cleverly averted disaster after disaster. Bonzy took a couple of hits, but he was already sad, so it wasn't like anyone noticed. When we reached the last, inner circle of the cult, we took a small vote about who would take point, and the most dangerous position, on our last mission. Bonzy doesn't even finish listening, instead waddling out onto the dark grass and honking his nose with the deepest frown on his face.

&nbsp;

The cultists debate killing me, but the leader lets Bonzy draw closer. I think it was out of curiosity rather than an ingenious plan, but whatever drove him allowed Bonzy to draw within punching distance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:39

There were no words, no puns, only the cold stares of two men in the dark, surrouned by ancient chanting and dark magic that warps the very flesh of any who touch it. Then Bonzy pulls out a long balloon (which I mimicked, having practiced this for a week in advance).

&nbsp;

“You know what I hate most about being a clown?” Bonzy asked after inflating the balloon.

“It's the assumption that I'm going to he happy, and smiling, and always ready with a joke. Everyone sees a clown and suddenly, they can't be unhappy. At least, not really unhappy. How can someone with a lifetime of jokes and puns ever be sad? Shouldn't they be smiling and laughing and carrying around rubber chickens all the time?”

&nbsp;

Bonzy shows the balloon to the cultist, revealing a puppy. I offered the real one to my GM.

&nbsp;

“But we can be sad. In fact, I think we HAVE to be sad. People want to be happy so much, they'll ignore everyone around them to keep their illusion of happiness. I accept that. After all, I'm Bonzy. My job is to be unhappy so everyone else can be happy, and smile, and laugh. That's what clowns do, we make people happy.”

&nbsp;

Bonzy reaches into his sleeve, and pulls out the only picture on his persons. A little girl with a young, smiling Bonzy.

&nbsp;

“I wanted Suzy to be happy.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:40

Bonzy reveals a grenade in his other hand, just underneath the balloon animal. As the cultist pulls away, he realizes he's too late to notice the grenade pin attached to the bottom loop on the feet of the balloon puppy. As it clings, the cultist drops the balloon and shouts for everyone to back up. Bonzy smiles as the rest of the team clears out the inner circle, leaving the leader and Bonzy near the center. As he's about to leave, Bonzy grabs the man's wrist and slides on a trick cuff.

&nbsp;

The leader looks down at his wrist, and then back up to Bonzy, who is honest to god smiling as the eldritch monster begins to manifest in the mortal world. Bonzy picks up the animal, holds it up, and grins gently as the eldritch god begins to take form.

&nbsp;

“That's all, folks.”

HONK

&nbsp;

The rest of the group looked for hours through the bloody, mangled mess of the god and cultists for anything of Bonzy, but they found nothing. Were it not for Bonzy blowing up the heart of the monster as it arrived, the undead god would have fully formed and taken the world with plagues of undeath and decay, but now it lay broken and would need to reform over eons in the cold reaches of space.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Bonzy's Fun Times The Finale**, 02/09/2015, 23:41

The party did manage to find something of Bonzy, finding a lone, old photo of a smiling clown and a little girl.

&nbsp;

They took the photo had a few words on the back, and the GM read them in a quiet voice.

&nbsp;

“To Bonzy. Thank you for always making her happy. Suzy thanks you.”

&nbsp;

They left the photo on a small gravemarker in the towns newer graveyard, and they decided to leave town. Before they left, one produced a rubber nose from his pocket and tied it to the grave.

And like that, they left Bonzy, not the sad clown.

The clown that was sad so everyone else could be happy.

**Anonymous**, unknown time

We tried to be 'Good necromancers' and managed to fuck it up so hard that we became the villains. Drow were invading a city, and we were trying to stop them. Using an ancient nexus of necromantic power, we created an army of the dead, two thousands strong, with three large flesh golems.

&nbsp;

Then we exhausted said Nexus and used the power to teleport this army.

&nbsp;

To the wrong city.

&nbsp;

Massive undead army literally pops up out of nowhere during the king's parade, everybody starts screaming, the five guys in necromantic robes at the head of the army start trying to calm people down by screaming at them, which just makes things worse (we completely flunked every diplomacy and intimidate roll because nobody had those skills), they get attacked by guards and defend themselves using nonlethal chain lightning, making the populace even more terrified. A local death cult took this to be a sign from their god and started summoning even more undead while whispering prayers to the five necromancers.

&nbsp;

Before you know it the city is burning, the guard has been decimated, there have been thousands of casualties, and five mages are standing in the centre of the ruins, next to a fountain that has been desecrated, avoiding each other's gaze.

&nbsp;

>"So, uh..."

>"Yeah."

>"That was a thing."

>"It was. What now?"

>"I don't suppose we could just apologise and explain the misunderstanding?"

>All five necromancers look around at the city of death and fire that they inadvertently created

>"I don't think they would buy it."

>"Probably not."

>"Damn."

>"..."

>"Well, I don't know about you guys, but I need a drink."

>"Second."

>"Yep."

>"Can't make things any worse, I guess."

>"I think we destroyed all the taverns, guys."

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:17

Holy shit, this thread's alive?

&nbsp;

Still?

&nbsp;

Well, apparently the people want to hear of Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

The Saga begins where most of my tales of 'what the fuck just happened' did, Dark Heresy.

&nbsp;

Back when I didn't know how the rules worked (actually, I still don't. On purpose. Back then I cared.) I was shown a Random Character Generator for the system.

&nbsp;

What I ended up with was a guy who had only two real talents: Playing his Bass Guitar, and Running.

&nbsp;

He was mostly broke, only owning the cloths on his back, his Bass Guitar, and a Couch that was 'In remarkably good shape'.

&nbsp;

He was a psyker, one of the really weak ones (so weak it was actually impossible to tell IC if he was).

&nbsp;

He had a look that could only be described as 'Business casual, if it was slept in. For about a week.'

&nbsp;

When he was described to the group, one of my friends remarked 'So you're playing some sort of Magical Hobo?'

&nbsp;

That's where his name came from. The original name, that was rolled for, was immediately discarded for the moniker of 'Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo'.

&nbsp;

If you give me a minute, I'll start typing up the shit that happened.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:32

First mission for the Inquisitor, I wasn't in the group yet.

&nbsp;

They landed in the hive where I was living to investigate some sort of disappearance of an associate.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe was trying to remember where he put has bottle of Sacra.

&nbsp;

They met up with some local arbitrators, got some leads, and went hunting.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe played his Bass with a rhythm so perfect it created an impromptu dance party in the lower hive.

&nbsp;

The acolytes got into a heated firefight just outside the pub where Boxcar Joe was trying to drink his lunch in peace.

&nbsp;

He stepped out, and this is where I became aware of my surroundings.

&nbsp;

On my left, A tech-priest, some sort of imperial assassin, two guardsman, and someone who looks like they just stepped out of a pulp PI novel from the 50's. Trench coat, fedora, whole shebang.

&nbsp;

On my right, 50 genestealers. Give Or Take.

&nbsp;

I grabbed my bottle, and chucked it at the xenos.

&nbsp;

I won't lie and pretend I remember all of the numbers, but:

&nbsp;

>The bottle hit a Hive Tyrant that was invisable for some reason.

>Said hive tyrant had its eyes burned by the pure alcohol

>Hive tyrant thrashed into bridge.

>30+tonnes of Concrete and other building materials fall, killing all but two genestealers. One is shot by the detective, the other Joe kicks in the face so hard it gets decapitated.

&nbsp;

I then looked over at the stunned group.

&nbsp;

"Off-worlders, yeah? You have to watch the local cockroach population. bastards get real uppity every couple of years."

&nbsp;

I was then shanghaied into the group.

&nbsp;

I'm not going to tell all the DH related tales, but he lasted pretty much the entire campaign. Whenever he was directly involved in a confrontation, all rolls would go right to either end of the spectrum. Every other roll was a Crit or a Crit-Fail.

&nbsp;

In the end, he got sucked into the warp surfing his couch.

That isn't the end of his story.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:45

About a month later, I was running a Shadowrun game (4th if it matters).

&nbsp;

They were all rolling up characters, and there was one new guy who wasn't there for the DH game.

&nbsp;

He opted for a random creation thing.

&nbsp;

Ended up with a technical pacifist Hobo street shaman who lived on a couch in a downtown alleyway.

&nbsp;

He owned a Bass Guitar, Aviator shades that looked slightly too big for him, and his couch was even described as 'in remarkibly good shape'.

&nbsp;

We all joked that two different computers with two different random generators had created Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

After explaining why it was so fucked up to the new guy, he laughed and named his character Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

The game went along normally for a while, and then the first combat happened.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe grabbed a can of tomato soup, spent a point of edge, grabbed six dice, and let fly at one of the guys trying to mug him.

&nbsp;We have 

a rule when it comes to exploding dice: every other time a die 'explodes' the intended effect gets bigger.

&nbsp;

27 hits later, all seven thugs (one of whom was hiding around the corner) were dead from the side effects of that thrown can. One gun also discharged into a passing truck, instantly killing the driver with a head-shot and bringing the delivery van to a crashing halt into the entrance of the alley.

&nbsp;

Boxcar Joe starts freaking out, because stopping the thugs cost him his dinner.

&nbsp;

Before anyone in the group could console him, the back door of the delivery van popped open revealing the randomly rolled for cargo: Assorted food-stuffs.

&nbsp;

The game lasted about six months, and in the second to the last session Boxcar Joe lost control of a spell and got thrown into a magic portal out of reality.

&nbsp;

After that game, a couple of our players went their separate ways. We played some games with some new guys, and then I ran into one of the dudes who left.

&nbsp;

He had a story to tell about Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 01:59

Turns out that she played in a Delta Green game, and one of the guys in the group, using some form of random generator, ended up creating Boxcar Joe.

&nbsp;

When she met him for the first time in the game, she started laughing about the character, saying he sounded like someone from an earlier game: Boxcar Joe the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

At this point, according to her telling, the group fell silent. They showed her the sheet.

&nbsp;

Name: Boxcar Joe, the Magic Hobo.

&nbsp;

They then informed her that it was a running joke for a couple of local groups, where a musically inclined 'Magic Hobo' with a couch 'in surprisingly good shape' had turned up in more than a few random character generators.

&nbsp;

Part of the running joke was that Boxcar Joe played merry-hell with the dice-gods and the laws of probability.

&nbsp;

So then I asked her to find out when these games happened in relation to ours.

&nbsp;

After doing some math (and a little bit of guesswork) I made an interesting discovery: Firstly, due to a combination of game schedules and campaign lengths, it seems as though Boxcar Joe was not in any two games at once. In parallel running games yes, but if one game was on a Tuesday and so was another, something would happen that would amount to Boxcar Joe going away for that one session (like the guy being sick).

&nbsp;

Secondly: Every time Boxcar Joe has left a game, he hasn't died. At least not in a way that the body was ever found.

&nbsp;

Sucked into a portal, thrown off a cliff, Gellar Field failure, etc. Almost certain deaths in every-case, but no body ever found.

&nbsp;

Sometimes the game ends and Boxcar Joe just hitches a ride out of town or something, never to be seen again.

&nbsp;

As a result, I have a sneaking suspicion that every appearance of the character 'Boxcar Joe' is in fact the same person.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Waffle House Millionaire**, 04/22/2011, 02:07

As far as my personal theory goes I have two pieces of evidence in my favor: Every instance of his apperance that I can find involved both a random character generator, and the laws of probability going right out the window.

&nbsp;

The implications of this same person appearing in (no particular order) Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Shadowrun, Exalted, Old AND New Worlds of Darkness, Deadlands, Call of Cthulhu, Delta Green, DRYH, Star Wars, MAID, six different GURPS games, D&D (Faerun, Ebberon, Dark Sun, Spell Jammer, and at least two homebrew settings), Fantasy Craft, Spy Craft, and about six different homebrew games?

&nbsp;

Fucked if I know.

&nbsp;

Not sure I want to.

&nbsp;

A friend of mine once pointed out that if we swapped the couch out for a phone-booth, he would bare an uncanny resemblance to The Doctor.

&nbsp;

I'd rather not think on that possibility too hard.

>Look, I'm not saying there are secret meetings where priests and paladins plan the destruction of undead, but the recent influx of humans adventurers into our catacombs is no coincidence, and past dwarf immigration into our outer dungeons hugely problematic. If we don't close our borders and force these lesser creatures away, we'll be facing the downfall of underworld society as we know it.

My friend and I are really unoriginal, when we make PCs. We'll usually base them off of already established fictional characters. In Shadowrun, we played as a hitman duo (me being a cyborg, him being a mage) called the Krane aros_ Essentially, they were Frasier and Niles Crane from Frasier. When our characters were introduced, the party's stealth expert was eavesdropping on our latest hit- a client's embezzling coworker shot between the eyes in the middle of dinner. The dialogue went more or less like this.

"It appears our target got his... just deserts."

"..."

"I'm sorry, I dont know what came over me."

"You're right though. This is one hit wont be losing a wink of sleep over."

"l never knew felt so strongly about corporate embezzling."

"Not that. Whoever mixes High Chinese decor with a Persian rug deserves what's coming to him."

"Ugh! Shoot him again!"

&nbsp;

Oh wow this thread is still up. Might as well wedge in a couple more of my favorite Krane Brother moments.

&nbsp;

We were playing out one of those infiltrate the fancy party scenarios. Niles (my friend) had joined another one of our guys in luring a target (an orc) into a wine cellar so we could kidnap him. They failed in knocking him out stealthily and he fought back. Went into a berserk rage, punched Niles into a pile of barrels and got the other guy in the choke hold.

"Grk! Niles! Use magic!"

"l don't think my brother has disabled the anti-magic generator yet."

"Hit him, then!"

"l dont think he'll even feel it..."

"Hit him with a wine bottle!"

"Oh! Good idea!"

His player rolls to find wine from a subpar year, before bashing the orc With it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Another was later in that campaign when we got into a firefight with some Mutri (Bulgarian mobsters). After killing the mobsters, I started undoing the dead boss's belt.

"If wanted him so bad, could have merely wounded him."

"Oh ha ha! I'm simply trying to get the man's belt!"

"Really, Frasier? You're resorting to thievery, now?"

"For God's sake man, he's wearing a brown Armani belt with black shoes! BLACK shoes, Niles!"

"Unforgivable. "

"There, there, little one, you're safe now I have the perfect set of brown loafers to pair you with at ho- wait. This isnt real leather! It's a knock-off. have been deceived!"

"Just like that waitress fancied on our assignment in Thailand. What was his name again?"

**The Legend of Sir Bacon**

&nbsp;

So my players are travelling through some mountains and encounter an ogre. Among the ogre's loot sack is a live pig. They decide to take the pig with them for companionship and possible food. After a while they forget about the pig as it really doesn't add much. After slaying a dragon and looting it's horde I roll up a Headband of Intellect which the two spell casters begin arguing over.

&nbsp;

**Wizard**: I should get the headband as I have the most need for it.

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: I should get it because you already have enough intelligence.

&nbsp; 

**Wizard**: My spells are more powerful.

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: Mine are more versatile.

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: Give it to the pig.

&nbsp; 

**Party**: What?

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: Give it to the pig and stop arguing.

&nbsp; 

**Wizard**: But...

&nbsp; 

**Warlock**: But...

&nbsp; 

**Fighter**: \*takes the headband from them and gives it to the pig.\*

&nbsp; 

**Pig**: Hello, companions.

&nbsp; 

They ended up training the pig as a fighter, commissioning it some armour and now Sir Bacon is a proud and loyal member of they party.

Once, we had an elf who fucked one human, once, and developed this psychotic obsession with bringing him back to life after he died.

&nbsp;

She sort of faded into the background after a while, we forgot about her, but two campaigns later her research started popping up, and this escalated until it turned out that she was basically getting ready to harvest all life on Earth to try and bring her pet goldfish back to life. ay the end of it were were up to our balls in hideous soul-stealing goblin mutants that ate souls and vomited them back up as pearl catalysts for some ancient resurrection ritual.

&nbsp;

Five fucking campaigns of fighting this insane elf, motivated by love and heartbreak to destroy the world and overthrow the will of the gods to bring her husband back, because SOMEONE just HAD to hit on the elf chick.

&nbsp;

Way to fucking go, Riley.

You say that now, but you'd be eating your thumbs by the end of it. It's so enraging to go through these enormously fierce trials, and then realize that they arent clever at all, they were just engineered by a woman with infinite time and no sense of proportion.

&nbsp;

Example: Her research notes were all written in Dwarvish, which was the language of choice for scientific notation. aut then apparently she thought "oh hey, someone might read my notes and figure out my plans."

&nbsp;

Now a sensible person might start writing in code. She destroyed the entire Dwarvish civilization, and annihilated their culture. Then she invented Esperanto and taught it to the humans. Nobody speaks Dwarvish except her anymore. Fucking unbelievable. THIS WAS A WHOLE CAMPAIGN.

**Anonymous**, 06/02/2012, 06:24

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say. The whole affair is just so agonizing from start to finish that it hurts just thinking of it. 

&nbsp;

Like in campaign three, when she introduced a wonder-crop that was like a combination between Potatoes, Wheat and Rice. Grew in huge paddies, each one was the size of a bowling ball, you could take in five crops a year easy, didnt deplete the soil, and, oh yeah, after the tenth year they basically flooded the atmosphere with sentient anthrax, to induce migration inland. YAY.

&nbsp;

Or like in campaign two, when she tore open the abyss with a huge ring painted with seven hundred gallons of her own blood carefully extracted and frozen over the course of decades, and used it to suck out the very spirits of entropy and chain them to her will so that she could put out the sun for the fifteen minutes she needed to do some stupid syzygy shit. No no, not because the sun needed to vanish for the alignment herself, she just wanted better lighting to see the stars. Not like she couldbe just used a telescope or anything.

&nbsp;

Every fucking time, we end up dealing with this hideous series of catastrophes, and a campaign later we realize just how trivial the actual motivations behind them were.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In his defense, this all started because we foreverDM'd him. Not exactly subtle revenge. I mean at least it's still fun, and while you're playing it you never notice, but then afterwards you're left going "did we just spend six months cockblocking an elf?"

&nbsp;

And the answer is yes. Six months cockblocking an elf. There was sentient anthrax and bandersnatches involved, sure, but when you get down to it it was cockblocking an elf.

This was a wrap up for a module we were playing, but I had fun the whole way. I played Krod, the half orc rogue... with a flail. Because in pathfinder, just about any weapon can get sneak attack damage. Krod is over 7 feet tall and speaks in the third person whenever he thinks someone is watching (Said to the Paladin: "Krod suggest you look other way while he shopping"). He wasn't dumb, but people never expect the idiot to be running a crime ring.

&nbsp;

Krod was a good stealth guy, but he shined in intimidation (+13 at lvl 3). This made for great moments as the game went on. The first time he was sneaking around, I fumbled his stealth roll. I looked at the GM, "Krod rears up and screams at the top of his lungs, 'YOU NO SEE KROD!'". I critted the roll. According to the GM, I stunned all the goblins there except for one who immediately went back to doing what he was doing previously and desperately tried to pretend I was not there. 

&nbsp;

That was Krod. One of his quotes was, "Only two things see Krod: dead things and things that know better than to admit it."

&nbsp;

So at the end of a module, my group is breaking up a local cult and we get caught in the middle of the leadership while trying to steal incrimenating documents. So we fight and against all odds defeat the leadership and their "Mask" golem (it helped when Krodd kneecapped it with a "sneak attack" with his two handed flail). Krod's standing over the cult leader and the guy give his BBEG last words.

&nbsp;

BBEG: I should have known you were unbelievers from the start!

K: *Shrugs* Krod always consider self militant agnostic. Krod not really know what to believe. *Hefts Flail* And he is VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THAT!

&nbsp;

CRUNCH. Good old Krod.

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2013, 20:07

Still, one of my favorite moments was when I had to ad lib a distraction. The group had infiltrated the earlier mentioned cult and were being processed. Our mage wanted to sneak off to check on some enchantment or another and I volunteered to keep their attention. The GM smirks and says, "Okay, what do you do."

&nbsp;

Me: Krod tells an entertaining story to distract the Acolytes.

GM: Okay... tell me a story. No roll. Tell me the story.

&nbsp;

Challenge accepted.

&nbsp;

Me: Okay, Krod gets them talking about themselves and eventually says "Krod had lots of jobs before coming here: Bouncer, bodyguard, gigolo, city guard"

GM: Gigolo?

Me: *Nods* "Yup, Krod was kept man for noble lady. She get off on Krod not being fancy. Krod had to quit though."

GM: One of the acolytes says, "Why did you quit?"

Me: "Fancy pants suitor get mad at Krod for taking his woman. Challenge Krod to duel. Then Krod kill him."

GM: "And she kicked you out?"

Me: "No, Nobel Lady get off on that too. Police get real mad though."

GM: "But duels are legal."

Me: "Yes, but only if you kill man during the duel."

GM: "...you killed him outside of the duel?"

Me: "Fancy Pants tell Krod to choose weapon! Krod choose surprise!"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 05/28/2013, 19:47

Oh Krod had a lot of fun in a short set of campaigns. At one point, Krod is hanging with his group as we travel by river. When the GM notes we are passing another boat, he asked us where we were. I said Krod was in the Crow's nest. 

GM: The boat is too small, there is no crow's nest.

Me: ...he built one.

GM: He can't build a crow's nest.

Me: I haven't chosen a craft skill yet. "Krod is carpenter in free time. He enjoy working with hands in way that doesn't require he put down tarp."

GM: *Sigh* you have no tools.

Me: Krod glares at some spare planks and they know better than to not be a crow's nest. I roll to intimidate the wood!

GM: ...roll it.

&nbsp;

Krod now has the craft skill: Angry Carpenter.

It's true, good feels aren't as entertaining. I'll share one I guess, to help along.

&nbsp;

I first started playing D&D with my brothers and a few close friends in grade school, so young I don't actually remember when. To me it was just something to do with my cool older brothers. My favorite character back then, because I was just a kid, was an insane elf wizard. I played him as having been driven mad by a demon that tormented him in his youth, then let him lose as a joke. Of course I was just a kid, so this was hardly serious roleplay; he was lolsorandum crazy, not legit crazy.

&nbsp;

So one of my brothers was playing a paladin whose high CHA had made him the party face. We're in this fuck-huge swamp swarming with lizardmen trying to make our way to the central temple when we get jumped by a whole tribe of the fuckers. Paladin steps up to negotiate. Turns out they only speak draconic.

&nbsp;

Guess who is the only one who speaks draconic.

&nbsp;

My older brother turns to my kid self - an immature child playing as a batshit insane wizard remember - with just this absolute grimace contorting his face. "OK kid. You tell them EXACTLY WHAT I SAY." He was hoping to get his CHA bonus in there somehow by sort of leading the negotiations. I’m like, “OK bro.”

&nbsp;

"We just want to pass through, no trouble."

I turn to the DM. "He says he's here to woo your best lizardgirl."

&nbsp;

Brother's eye is twitching. DM is laughing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:40

The point is that having a story of a good memory that is told well is rare, because of how difficult it can be to make it engaging for readers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:38

Turns out this lizardman IS a girl, you can’t tell with these things. She gets all surprised, looks around. She says that’s her, since she’s the biggest and the strongest.

&nbsp;

My older brother is trying his hardest to stay in character. “What did it say?”

&nbsp;

“Sh, it’s a girl.” I try to look all wise, nod thoughtfully. “She says to prove yourself you have to perform the dance of peace.” Brother’s face is straight up convulsing. I’m looking cool. “It’s a lizardfolk tradition. You’d know about it if you’d studied, like me.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 01/17/2014, 14:38

“Tell it – I mean her. Tell her that I will gladly do what is required to prove ourselves peaceful.”

&nbsp;

I turn back to the DM. “He says he can prove his love through the medium of dance. He wants to dance with you.”

&nbsp;

And that’s how we partied with the lizardmen in the swamp, neither side having any idea what was really happening but the kid. I loved those days. I was a lot younger, so I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with my older brothers. It was nice of them to include me at all.

&nbsp;

Oh I guess I also tricked the rouge into performing ritual combat at dawn for the chieftess’s hand.

Guys did I ever tell you about the time I completely accidentally ruined a professionally made campaign for Dungeons and Dragons thanks to a single roll

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**calibrate**

Please explain 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**number-one-chiquita-dave**

Ok so we had to fight our way to the bottom of a castle to stop a group of cultists from summoning an Orc god to the world and we got there and the ritual was already going so I ran up to the god, who had already begun to manifest, and cast Finger of Death, which kills any target I touch if they fail a Fortitude roll. Since he was a god, he had a good constitution and would have certainly survived

&nbsp;

Except the DM rolled a 1

&nbsp;

and the god exploded

I'm proud to say that my Paladin once committed Orc genocide, by creating concentration camps where Baleful Polymorph was cast en masse to turn them into harmless animals, birds and doves to give them 'new lives' freed from their cursed bodies. 

&nbsp;

We actually turned into a religion, where orcs would strive to make themselves sufficiently pure to ascend. Since we'd already killed off all the warriors and the orc priesthood in the crusades, there was no one to turn them back: And accordingly to the rules for Baleful Polymorph, you lose your mind permanently if you fail a Will Save, which was mathematically impossible for these 0-level NPCs to pass. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, they built a statue of my character, in marble. In one hand, he takes the hand of an orc child. In the other, he holds a dove, symbolizing the promise of rebirth.

&nbsp;

He also has a huge, shit-eating grin.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Actually, we never killed anyone. 

&nbsp;

Not a single innocent was harmed. We could not kill women and children, even if they were orcs. 

&nbsp;

The solution, instead, was deemed incredibly humane, farsighted, and it looked really pretty. (i.e. The visual symbolism of a huge crowd of orcs become a huge cloud of doves.) 

&nbsp;

It was also amazingly evil, and my character loved it because he hated their entire race.	

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Probably, but - Here's the thing - we didn't force the change on them. The whole idea was that people would WANT to be changed.

&nbsp;

How did we do it? Well, we insisted on humane treatment for the orcs. We set up camps, made sure they were well-fed and clean, had Paladins sweep the place to make sure there were no abuses.

&nbsp;

And then we began to indoctrinate them. We told them that orcs are cursed, because their gods made them evil and twisted. But not to worry: If your heart is pure, you can transcend. You can become more, and live a pure, innocent life. (As a bird/fish/rabbit/whatever, but we universally did birds.)

&nbsp;

Every few months, there would be a Festival of Ascension, where orcs would be transformed en masse. It was a privilege! You had to be on your best behavior, and the camp counsilor had to go "Yes, he's been sufficiently redeemed. He can Ascend now."

&nbsp;

Can you see the beauty of this? We were teaching them to embrace their own annihilation. If any of them failed to transform, or transformed then changed back, we would welcome them back to the nearest camp, and tell them gently: "The path of ascension is not an easy one. It is good that you came back, so we can begin again. Not everyone makes it the first time, but we are here to guide your steps along the True Way."

&nbsp;

Basically, we made them WANT it. We made them WANT to become mindless animals. And I don't think the DM cottoned on to how insidiously evil this was, because I always pitched it as a shamelessly good act. No hypocrisy, my Paladin actually fought racists who wanted to exterminate them, gave passionate speeches about how "Orcs are not *evil*. They are a misguided people, formed by a cruel god. But we do not have to treat them the same way! We can uplift them, give them new lives beyond the misery of their bodies! We can make them pure!"

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Anonymous**, 04/05/16, 19:48

Exactly. You know what the biggest uproar in the camps were? Bribery, because orcs were paying to BE THE FIRST IN LINE.

&nbsp;

There was a riot, because the orcs wanted to BE CHANGED FIRST.

&nbsp;

It's like if people actively fought to be gassed. Each time, the guards had to restore order, and there were complaints about "Why does the criteria for Ascension have to be so stringent? Can't we allow more of them to be transformed? Our God is a forgiving God, after all."

&nbsp;

After a whole conclave was assembled, we eventually concluded that orc children were born free of original sin, and could be immediately ascended. However, we needed the consent of their parents, and at least three people to vouch for the character of their orc parents. 

&nbsp;

So this is how it feels like to be Double Hitler.

This stans a chain reaction with fuels the creation ofa new star. A star born of death. The cries of many are lost to a burning blaze in the aether Some say you can still hear the rattling of bones echoing around this star.

Tongue in cheek. This shot campaign is affectionately referred to in our group as "Mr Bone's wild ride"

Here's a story about how the very first pathfinder game of our game went down, roughly 6 years ago.

&nbsp

>continent is being invaded drow and a bunch of weird aberrations

>shit is immediately getting fucked, our party is a drow, a magus (me), barbarian, gunslinger and a cavalier

>we're going around trying to figure out what's going on, apparently the invaders are wanting to destroy these 'seals' around the continent which keeps their deity powerless

>they've recently broken the first seal

>oh and by the way, when they do that it's the literal equivalent of a magical nuke

>yeah

>it's obviously a serious situation and we're working with THE GOOD KINGDOMT to not die horribly

>we're actually making progress, save some elf priestess for some reason .I don't remember what exactly, but the tables were finally turning, the court wizard trusts us

>except for the fact that the gunslinger killed the drow and got shanked by my magus but nevermind that

>suddenly, as we come back from our latest assingment, the guards of the palace tells us to fuck off

>our services no longer needed, we have crossbows pointed toward us

>we say fuck that, converse with them and do a bit of digging

>apparently every single noble house decided to backstab one another in an autistic play for power, and since we weren't in on it, we shouldn't get involved

>this is the part were i remind every one of you that the continent was literally being nuked and we're the only people that actually had any sort of success against the invaders

>swiftly chased our of the palace under bolt fire

>party manages to retreat into the wilderness, takes several minutes to process what happened

>we no longer can assist the kingdom reliably due to losing all of our contacts, and everyone sans the cavalier doesn't even want to help them at this point after that

>drow (who was revived) awkwardly mentions he was a double agent, and suggest we could just join them instead

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

>me and the barbarian basically just say: "that's cool, but no thanks"

>cavalier just manages to go "well you are bad man and i will face you, but not now" (Mind you, the cavalier was an excellent player, but not even he could rationalized what just happened to us)

>the party quite literally sort of gives up or splits

>me and the barbarian just outright leave for an isolated continent

>drow fully joins the bad guys

>cavalier remains in his stalwart crusade, with the DM implying him and the drow would fight in the end

>they didn't because after that split nothing else happened, since there was no more campaign to run, and the DM couldn't be assed to run said battle

>oh, and the gunslinger was still dead

&nbsp

It really was weird how everyone just kind of lost interest the moment that 'power play' happened. It made absolutely no sense, and none of us can rationalize why it happened to this day.

>dreams tell him to go off on an expedition to find... something, he's not sure. But his dreams always turn out to true so he doesn't question it

>Teams up with his former manager/promoter bard and an elven rogue tagalong because they need a guide through the wilderness

>a jittering, rambling drunk who needs his handlers with him at all times, still prone to bouts of rage

>still hits harder with his fists than the bard does with his mace

>also now he can read minds and inflict nightmares on people (Dark Tapestry is fucking awesome)

And the best part is, he's still the party leader through charisma and force of personality.

Identity death was actually what drove the BBEG of one of the campaigns I was on. 

&nbsp;

It was a game with the house-rule that strong curses can't EVER be broken, which adds a degree of tension to even joke curses like Opposite Gender. 

&nbsp;

The BBEG used to be a Neutral Good Fighter that lived to help others and dreamed of being a great hero one day. He formed an adventuring party to try to stop an evil wizard, and was able to do a lot of great things. The final battle between him and the wizard, however, ended with them both being cursed with Opposite Alignment thanks to a gambit of the wizard's backfiring; the Wizard went from Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good with his memories of the atrocities he inflicted on his enemies in the name of his own ego, while the Fighter became Neutral Evil despite having a lifetime of memories of helping others out of the goodness of his heart. 

&nbsp;

The Wizard, now seeing his old self from a new perspective, couldn't live with the guilt and killed himself, but the Fighter spiraled downwards, remembering a lifetime of being good but cursed to be unable to understand WHY any of it mattered to him. Even trying to act on his memories didn't work, because the curse COMPELLED him to remain Neutral Evil. The cognitive dissonance eventually drove him completely insane; he went full evil warlord to try and kill the memories. By the campaign, he was so far gone he mistook our party's paladin for his younger self and became obsessed with fighting him. We didn't find out until much later in the campaign why he kept screaming at Pally to "tell him why" every time we fought him.

>Started with 100 gold.

You know what? If someone wanted to try this I would let them. But you are looking at max dex of -4, maybe 5. 0 AC and 5 foot max speed. 

&nbsp;

But if you really wanted to waddle around as ball of twine man, sure go for it. You will look sily and not be that effective but what the hell people do retarded shit all the time. It would only take a few enemy hits to cut through your rope armor anyway.

Marge Dooley, aka Literaly Satan

I used her three times, one in each game. What I intended to be just an elderly named NPC with an angry and confrontational demeanor, ended up being the finger of death for all my campaigns.

&nbsp;

First time, she kills all PCs on account of bullshit luck, the players attempting to murder an old lady and shotguns being more powerful than initialy thought. Second time, I put her as a background NPC to get a reaction out of some returning players. The newbie looking at them overreacting decided to take a shot at her at his confusion, misses, kills a policeman and then the encounter goes tits up, they get caught in the crossfire and die. Third time is just unfathomable. This time I put her in a Dark Heresy game, completely unrelated, but described with the same demeanor, same rickety build and purple sweater, but in a different universe. It would be funny, until we noticed something.

&nbsp;

Every time someone attacked her, they missed. Every time an explosive was to go up near her, it ended up being a dud. All out of luck. From that point forward, the players took her along and she followed them for a good 5 session, while remaining unharmed, unfazed and just grumpy. Eventually, it's final boss time. They load her with some heretical psycher fueled proton pack I can't remember the name off to fire at a very depowered Lord of Change from a distance, with a faint hope of her fucking up. She managed to resist posession with a shitty 5% chance of making it twice. The old bat was made of iron.

&nbsp;

A few misses after it gets to a couple hitpointts and it turns that Marge is going for the ultimate kill steal.Then someone offhandidly mentions "at least she wont kill us this time". Then the weapon hits a random AoE attack. 38 damage to all. None survived. Third TPK.

&nbsp;

At that point and after a solid minute of silence, I muster a "Marge Dooley enters whatever hellportal she came out of and leaves us forever."

&nbsp;

I've never used her again

I dare not to
